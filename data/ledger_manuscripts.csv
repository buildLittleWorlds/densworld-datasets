902-09-20,erris_pol,On the Architecture of the Library,,prime_architecture,,,capital,"Pol's treatise on prime architecture. 'The primes are not accidents of evolution. They are addresses in the Library. When we observe a creature cycling on intervals of 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, we are watching it navigate the stacks.'",EV-902-001
918-02-15,erris_pol,Forms and the Dens,,dens_instability,,,capital,"Pol explains Dens proximity effects: 'In the Dens, the distinction between Form and matter dissolves. What elsewhere requires a body to read, there reads itself.'",EV-918-001
915-04-10,pell_anster,Beyond Species,,classification_reform,,,capital,"Anster proposes abandoning species-based classification: 'When I ask what kind of entity something is, I am not asking about its substance. I am asking: How should I approach it? What kind of interaction will succeed?'",EV-915-001
917-11-15,pell_anster,The Persuadability Spectrum,,level_variance_and_transitions,,,capital,Anster's treatise on level variance: 'The hardest level to diagnose is the one whose defining characteristic is the capacity to question categories.' Also introduces the harm principle: treating a Level 4 entity as Level 2 is 'a form of violation.',EV-917-001
838-09-15,pemlik_tross,On the Geometry of Affinities,,constellation_method,,,western_archive,Tross's foundational treatise introducing the Constellation Method.

923-07-01,rellen_voss,On the Problem of Finding,,navigation_resonance,,,western_archive,Voss's major treatise proposing the resonance framework: 'How does the young stakdur know WHERE to go? The Quintic Cycle is not inscribed on its body. It exists in morphospace—a landscape of Forms that bodies read but do not create. Navigation is reading in motion.',EV-923-001
905-06-15,sareth_moll,An Investigation of Ghosts,,membrane_scars,,,western_archive,Moll's foundational treatise defining ghosts as 'membrane scars'—patterns that persist after their substrates die. Opens with the famous Third Mill case: 'The mill burned in Year 777. Yet workers passing that site still feel the grinding. The substrate is gone. The pattern persists.',EV-905-001
912-11-01,sareth_moll,On the Rates of Fading,,decay_curves,,,western_archive,"Moll's systematic study of decay rates: 'I have measured 200 decay curves. No two are identical. Yet patterns emerge.

916-03-15,archon_vells,The Problem of Manifestation,,ingression_question,,,capital,Archon Vells names the problem Pol left unexplained: how do Forms cross from potential to actual?

924-08-20,archon_vells,What Cannot Be Said,,research_reflection,,,capital,"Vells reflects on eight years of ingression research.

Establishes ingression mechanics as a field of systematic study.",EV-934-002
940-12-01,archon_vells,What I Have Measured,,career_reflection,,,capital,"Vells ends his career uncertain but accomplished. 'I have spent forty years counting the seconds between potential and actual. I know that a complex Form takes longer than a simple one. I know that prior manifestation creates channels. But I do not know what is happening.' The fundamental question remains unanswered, but the mechanics are established.",EV-940-001
930-11-15,kella_vorn,On the Taxonomy of Failure,,pathology_synthesis,,,capital,"Vorn's magnum opus synthesizing 15 years of research and 2,000+ cases. Unifies the work of Keth (landscapes), Tross (boundaries), Voss (navigation), Moll (ghosts), Strand (horizons), and Mord (federations) into a coherent taxonomy of failure.

935-04-10,kella_vorn,A Taxonomy of Dissolution,,boundary_failure_classification,,,capital,"Vorn's detailed study of boundary dissolution builds on her earlier synthesis and her rediscovery of Pemlik Tross. 'Not all boundaries fail the same way. Some crumble gradually, worn down by persistent forces. Others collapse suddenly, as if some critical threshold were crossed.' Completes the Tross framework with failure analysis.",EV-935-003
938-08-25,kella_vorn,Exceptions to the Rule,,anomaly_analysis,,,capital,"Vorn catalogs the exceptions—cases that dissolve too fast, too slow, or in ways that violate every rule.

923-09-01,tobben_rast,On the Role of Chance in Learning,,initialization_theory,,,bureau_of_computational_standards,"Rast publishes his synthesis on initialization and learning dynamics. The work challenges the classical bias-variance tradeoff, showing that overparameterized models can generalize well despite fitting training data exactly. Ghost persistence — essential structure that survives pruning — emerges as a key concept.",EV-923-004
921-09-20,prenn_vash,On the Extraction of Pure Forms,,feature_extraction,,,capital_archives,"Vash publishes her foundational work on feature extraction.
