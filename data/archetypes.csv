JRN-LF,The Lucky Fool,journey,Few negative events in first half; no creature attacks before day 15; profit in top quartile; often first-time traders,Uneventful early days -> good fortune continues -> success arrives without understanding why,"78% profitable, 15% break-even, 7% loss",Bagbu's third journey (year 871); Trader Ellum Vast (year 903),13.1,The Lucky Fool archetype is dangerous precisely because it feels like skill. These traders do not know what dangers they avoided.
JRN-WH,The Weathered Hand,journey,"Distributed challenges throughout; multiple creature encounters, weather events, trade difficulties; none catastrophic; each resolved within 2 days","Problem -> resolution -> problem -> resolution, steady throughout journey","65% profitable, 25% break-even, 10% loss",Bagbu's hundred-and-twelfth journey (year 889); most experienced traders,47.1,The Weathered Hand does not avoid problems - they face approximately the same number of challenges as other traders. They simply resolve them before compounding occurs.
JRN-DO,The Doomed Optimist,journey,Few early problems (suggesting effective planning); cascade of failures in final third; careful preparation precedes sudden collapse,Smooth sailing -> continued calm -> catastrophic failure in final days,"12% profitable, 18% break-even, 70% loss",Bagbu's seventy-eighth journey (year 885); Prime road washout victims (year 901),12.2,"Preparation protects you from the known, and the known is not what kills you."
JRN-HA,The Happy Accident,journey,Maximum event density in early days; chaotic signature with many events positive and negative; disaster creates opportunity,Everything goes wrong -> continued chaos -> unexpected opportunity emerges from ruins,"52% profitable, 23% break-even, 25% loss",Bagbu's two-hundred-and-third journey (year 897),9.9,The Happy Accident is not merely luck - it is the capacity to recognize opportunity within disaster. The same signature that destroys one trader creates conditions for another's success.
JRN-UN,Unclassified Journey,journey,Mixed signatures that do not fit the four primary archetypes; may show transitions between types,"Variable; some show hybrid patterns, others exhibit novel structures","45% profitable, 30% break-even, 25% loss",Various; patterns not yet characterized,17.6,"The archetypes are useful, not exhaustive. These journeys remind us that our categories are tools, not truths."
CAR-BA,The Burnout Arc,career,"Intense early activity (multiple projects, rapid advancement, recognition); sudden collapse (extended leave, voluntary demotion, or field exit) around years 7-9",Years 1-3: Rapid success -> Years 4-6: Continued intensity with warning signs -> Years 7-9: Collapse -> Years 10+: Slow pace or exit,"25% return to high performance, 45% continue at reduced pace, 30% exit field","Coder TW-4471 (14 projects in 5 years, collapse in year 6)",19.2,"Burnout Arc collapses clustered at years 5, 7, and 11 - the yeller numbers. I have no explanation for this pattern."
CAR-SC,The Slow Climb,career,Steady progression with no early peaks; modest annual advancement; consistent but unremarkable output in early years,"Years 1-5: Entry-level, learning -> Years 6-10: Mid-level, consistent -> Years 11-15: Senior, expertise visible -> Years 15+: Peak productivity","70% reach senior positions, 20% plateau at mid-level, 10% transition to other fields","Analyst KR-2208 (invisible for 12 years, dominant after)",34.7,The Slow Climb is the most common archetype and often the most sustainable. Early invisibility predicts late dominance.
CAR-ES,The Eternal Student,career,"Continuous educational activity; courses, certifications, workshops; few completed projects; rare promotions; limited practical recognition","Years 1-3: Entry + heavy coursework -> Years 4-7: Continued education, changing specializations -> Years 8+: Extensive credentials, limited accomplishments","15% breakthrough eventually, 60% continue pattern indefinitely, 25% transition to teaching/support roles",Builder PN-3392 (23 certifications across 4 specializations in 15 years),17.3,"The archetype I find most troubling - perhaps because I recognize it in myself. There is always more to learn, and always a reason to delay."
CAR-AE,The Accidental Expert,career,"Chaotic early pattern (frequent job changes, mixed outcomes, no clear direction); unexpected specialization emerges from circumstance around years 6-8","Years 1-5: Multiple jobs, no direction -> Years 6-8: Forced engagement with unexpected problem -> Years 9-12: Discovered expertise -> Years 12+: Recognized authority","55% become recognized specialists, 30% find adjacent niches, 15% return to generalist pattern","Instrument maker VL-1056 (6 job changes, then atmospheric sensor innovation)",22.1,The Accidental Expert parallels the Happy Accident in journeys - chaos yielding unexpected success. Specialization often emerges at years 7 and 11.
CAR-UN,Unclassified Career,career,"Mixed signatures; may show archetype transitions (Burnout in first decade, Slow Climb in second); patterns not yet characterized","Variable; some shift between archetypes, others show novel patterns",Variable,Various; requires further study,6.7,Some workers shift between archetypes over time. The categories are approximate; lives are complex.
JRN-LF-V,The Lucky Fool (Variant),journey,Lucky Fool signature in experienced trader; early fortune despite evidence trader should know better,Similar to Lucky Fool but with ironic awareness of risks avoided,"82% profitable, 12% break-even, 6% loss",Bagbu notes he was sometimes Lucky Fool even after years of experience,2.3,Experienced traders can still be Lucky Fools. Wisdom does not prevent fortune.
JRN-WH-M,The Weathered Hand (Mastery),journey,Weathered Hand signature with faster resolution times; problems addressed before they fully manifest,Challenge anticipated -> preemptive response -> no disruption,"85% profitable, 12% break-even, 3% loss",Bagbu's journeys after year 900,4.8,The highest form of the Weathered Hand - problems solved before they become events in the signature.
CAR-BA-R,The Burnout Arc (Recovered),career,Burnout Arc followed by extended recovery period; eventual return to sustainable productivity,Classic Burnout -> Years of low activity -> Gradual rebuilding -> Sustainable late career,"45% reach original productivity, 40% find new equilibrium, 15% relapse",Coder TW-4471 if recovery succeeds,4.8,Recovery from burnout is possible but rare. The second career is often different in character from the first.
CAR-HY,The Hybrid Arc,career,Clear transition between archetypes; often Burnout -> Slow Climb or Eternal Student -> Accidental Expert,First archetype dominant years 1-10 -> Crisis or opportunity -> Second archetype emerges,Depends on transition type,Various; transitions at yeller number years,3.2,People can change. The archetype is not a prison - unless we make it one.
CAR-RF,The Refuser,career,Deliberate avoidance of patterns; frequent changes designed to prevent classification; anti-pattern as pattern,"Varied deliberately; changes jobs, specializations, employers to avoid predictability","35% successful by conventional measures, 40% unconventional success, 25% precarious",Meck Drune (trader who refuses classification),1.8,The irony: deliberate pattern-avoidance is itself a pattern. Meck Drune is classifiable precisely by their refusal to be classified.
JRN-RF,The Refuser (Journey),journey,"Deliberate route changes, unpredictable timing, varied goods; designed to prevent pattern detection",Unpredictable by design; no two journeys similar,"40% profitable, 35% break-even, 25% loss",Meck Drune (all journeys after year 906),0.5,"Meck Drune varies their routes, goods, companions to prevent pattern detection. The refusal is the pattern."
CAR-UK,The Unknowable,career,Genuinely resists classification; no archetype fits; behavior unpredictable even in retrospect,Unknown; each case unique,Unknown,Student JK-3847 (Jackson) at Klutch CC,0.3,Some individuals genuinely resist classification. Jackson was not following a pattern we have not discovered - he was not following a pattern at all. This is the limit I could not articulate.
JRN-UK,The Unknowable (Journey),journey,Genuinely resists classification; events do not form coherent pattern,Cannot be characterized,Unknown,Rare; most journeys eventually fit some pattern,0.2,Perhaps these are the journeys that teach us the most - the ones our tools cannot capture.
CAR-PR,The Prime Transition,career,"Major career transitions at yeller number years (5, 7, 11, 13); suggests underlying rhythm",Transitions clustered at prime years; stability between,"Similar to base archetype; transitions are timing, not type",Various; pattern visible across all archetypes,8.5,"The yeller numbers appear in career timing as they do in creature behavior and journey events. I do not understand why, but the pattern is undeniable."
