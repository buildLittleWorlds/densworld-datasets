The Prebel Effect,Instrument-free observation produces stable measurements; instrumented observation produces variance,Observer Effect / Measurement Problem,Quantum Physics,"In quantum mechanics, the act of measurement affects the state of the system being measured. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that certain pairs of properties cannot both be precisely measured.",Werner Heisenberg,"Physics and Philosophy (1958)",Course 2
Attractor Basins,The SW quadrant drains toward an invisible valley; all measurements flow downhill,Attractor Dynamics,Dynamical Systems,"In dynamical systems theory, an attractor is a set of states toward which a system tends to evolve. Basin of attraction is the set of initial conditions leading to the attractor.",Edward Lorenz,"Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow (1963)",Course 1
Resonant Modes,"Each sector 'rings' with a characteristic note when disturbed; phenomena repeat in the same locations",Eigenmodes / Normal Modes,Physics & Mathematics,"A normal mode is a pattern of motion in which all parts of a system oscillate at the same frequency. The eigenvalues determine these characteristic frequencies.",Joseph Fourier,"Théorie analytique de la chaleur (1822)",Course 1
Curved Coordinates,"Distances vary by observer; the same path measures differently in different directions",Non-Euclidean Geometry,Mathematics,"In non-Euclidean geometries, the parallel postulate fails. In curved spaces (Riemannian geometry), distances and angles behave differently than in flat space.",Bernhard Riemann,"On the Hypotheses Which Lie at the Foundations of Geometry (1854)",Course 2
Performativity of Classification,"Naming phenomena changes them; extensively classified phenomena tend to dissolve",Looping Effects / Performativity,Philosophy of Science,"Ian Hacking's 'looping effect' describes how classifying people changes them. Judith Butler extended performativity to identity formation. Categories are not passive descriptions but active interventions.",Ian Hacking,"The Looping Effects of Human Kinds (1995)",Course 3
Plural Sites,"The same landmark exists in multiple positions simultaneously for different observers",Superposition / Many-Worlds,Quantum Physics,"In quantum mechanics, superposition means a particle exists in all possible states until measured. The many-worlds interpretation suggests all possibilities are real in separate branches.",Hugh Everett,"Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics (1957)",Course 2
Negotiated Spatiality,Space is not given but emerges from ongoing labor; boundaries require maintenance,Relational Ontology / Process Philosophy,Philosophy,"Whitehead's process philosophy holds that reality consists of processes rather than static things. Relational ontology sees entities as constituted by their relations.",Alfred North Whitehead,"Process and Reality (1929)",Course 1-4
Topological Strain,"Surveyors feel 'pressure' in certain regions; psychological state correlates with geometric stability",Topology / Curvature,Mathematics & Physics,"Topology studies properties preserved under continuous deformation. Curvature in general relativity affects the path of objects and light. 'Strain' is a geometric concept in continuum mechanics.",Carl Friedrich Gauss,"Disquisitiones Generales circa Superficies Curvas (1827)",Course 1
Temporal Hysteresis,"The dens 'remembers' previous observations and modifies itself in response",Path Dependence / Hysteresis,Economics & Physics,"Hysteresis means a system's current state depends on its history, not just current conditions. Path dependence shows how past events constrain future possibilities.",Arthur Brian,"Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy (1994)",Course 4
Breach Sites,"Locations where normal spatiality fails entirely; instruments malfunction, observers are immobilized",Singularities / Edge Cases,Physics & Mathematics,"In general relativity, singularities are points where curvature becomes infinite. In complex systems, phase transitions occur at critical points where normal behavior breaks down.",Roger Penrose,"Gravitational Collapse and Space-Time Singularities (1965)",Course 2-3
The Western Prohibition,"Institutional policy forbidding surveys toward the dens",Selection Bias / Institutional Epistemology,Sociology of Knowledge,"What we know is shaped by what we choose to study. Institutions systematically ignore certain phenomena. The absence of data is itself data about power structures.",Michel Foucault,"The Order of Things (1966)",Course 4
Instrument Interference,"More instruments produce more variance; heavy instrumentation accelerates boundary drift",Quantum Decoherence / Observer Dependence,Quantum Physics,"Decoherence describes how quantum systems lose their quantum properties through interaction with measuring apparatus. The observer is not separate from the system.",Wojciech Zurek,"Decoherence and the Transition from Quantum to Classical (1991)",Course 2
Geometric Encoding,"Human language captures shape data that instruments miss",Embodied Cognition / Phenomenology,Philosophy & Cognitive Science,"Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology emphasizes that perception is bodily. Embodied cognition holds that cognition is shaped by the body. Language encodes spatial experience.",Maurice Merleau-Ponty,"Phenomenology of Perception (1945)",Course 3
I Let It In,"Yeller's phrase for accepting rather than resisting the dens",Acceptance / Negative Capability,Philosophy & Psychology,"Keats's 'negative capability' describes being comfortable with uncertainty. Acceptance-based approaches in psychology emphasize allowing experience rather than controlling it.",John Keats,"Letter to George and Tom Keats (1817)",All courses
The Basin's Center,"The invisible point toward which everything drains; never directly observed",Latent Variables / Hidden Attractors,Statistics & Machine Learning,"Latent variables are not directly observed but inferred from observable data. Hidden attractors in dynamical systems are not visible from initial conditions but determine long-term behavior.",Karl Pearson,"On Lines and Planes of Closest Fit (1901)",Course 1
