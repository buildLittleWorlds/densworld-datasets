HC-014,Mathematical Cartography,858,Mathematical methods will enable precise mapping of all territory,Methods work in stable territory; fail in unstable regions,20,Methods that work somewhere may fail elsewhere; domain matters,False
HC-003,Creature Behavior Prediction (First Wave),865,Seasonal patterns will enable reliable creature forecasting,Correlations found but accuracy insufficient for field deployment,20,Correlation is not prediction; biological systems resist simple models,False
HC-002,Universal Manuscript Dating,872,New methods will definitively date any manuscript,Methods improved but uncertainty remains for most documents,15,Physical methods have inherent limits; uncertainty is often irreducible,False
HC-006,Boundary Stabilization Attempt,875,Engineering interventions can stabilize Dens boundaries,All attempts failed; boundaries proved resistant to intervention,10,Some phenomena cannot be controlled; management may be best option,False
HC-015,Scholar Authentication Networks,878,Citation networks will establish scholarly authority,Networks created; gaming and manipulation became issues,15,Metrics can be gamed; quantification creates new problems,False
HC-001,Archive Automation Promise,880,Archives will be fully automated within 30 years,Archives still employ clerks; automation assists but does not replace,30,Automation augments human work; rarely replaces entirely,True
HC-005,Quarry Seasonal Calendar,882,Systematic observation will improve trapper safety,Calendar widely adopted; modest but real safety improvement,5,Description without prediction can still be valuable,True
HC-011,Creature Classification System,885,Complete taxonomy will enable systematic creature management,Taxonomy created but creatures don't follow categories consistently,12,Classification is useful shorthand; reality is messier than categories,False
HC-004,Dead-Man Rope Innovation,888,Simple tethering will reduce fall fatalities,Fatalities significantly reduced; technology widely adopted,3,Simple solutions sometimes work; not everything needs complexity,True
HC-008,Forgery Detection Methods,890,Expert examination will identify all forgeries,Mink Pavar forgeries detected; unknown number may remain undiscovered,7,Detection improves but never reaches certainty; some forgeries succeed,False
HC-016,Prime Number Pattern Discovery,892,Prime patterns govern creature behavior cycles,Patterns observed but mechanism unclear; predictive power limited,10,Patterns exist; causation harder to establish than correlation,True
HC-007,Moat System,895,Moat will create buffer zone and provide early warning,Moat slows boundary drift and enables warning; does not stop it,8,Managing problems is valid even without solving them,True
HC-009,Expedition Protocol (First Generation),895,Codified procedures will prevent expedition disasters,Ninth Expedition disaster showed limits of early protocols,5,Codification helps in known conditions; novel conditions require judgment,False
HC-012,Journey Record Standardization,898,Standardized records will reveal trading patterns,Records collected; patterns emerged but with significant noise,8,Data collection precedes insight; insight requires interpretation,True
HC-010,Census Mechanization,900,Mechanical counting will enable complete population tracking,Counting improved; population behavior remained complex,10,Counting is easier than understanding; numbers don't explain themselves,True
HC-017,Standardized Expedition Equipment,902,Standard equipment will reduce equipment-related failures,Equipment failures reduced; human error remained primary cause,3,Equipment improvement helps; human factors dominate outcomes,True
HC-013,Klutch CC Vocational Programs,905,Structured vocational training will guarantee employment,Training improved skills; employment depends on many factors,5,Training is necessary but not sufficient; outcomes have multiple causes,True
HC-018,Archive Indexing System,908,Comprehensive indexing will make all documents findable,Indexing improved access; some documents remain misfiled or lost,5,Better organization helps; perfect organization is unattainable,True
HC-019,Territorial Stability Surveys,910,Regular surveys will map stable vs unstable regions definitively,Surveys inform but stability changes over time; boundaries shift,8,Snapshot surveys miss dynamic processes; continuous monitoring needed,False
HC-020,Inter-Regional Communication Network,915,Network will enable real-time coordination across regions,Network established but delays and failures common,5,Infrastructure enables but doesn't guarantee coordination; cultural factors matter,True
