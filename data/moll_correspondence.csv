CML-L-001,960-06-15,corren_moll,sareth_moll,western_archive,capital,Family connection and early insight,Your work on ghost persistence opened my eyes to something. Patterns persist through their relations to other patterns. I believe language works the same way—words persist through their relations to other words.,none,persistence_parallel,collegial,first_articulation_of_linguistic_categories,CML-CORR-001
CML-L-002,960-08-22,sareth_moll,corren_moll,capital,western_archive,Response to linguistic parallel,Cousin—I am intrigued by your extension of my work. If ghosts fade through loss of contextual memory the observers who remember them may words fade through loss of contextual usage?,CML-L-001,ghost_language_parallel,encouraging,sareth_validates_approach,CML-CORR-002
CML-L-003,961-03-10,corren_moll,pelleth_strand,western_archive,capital_archives,Query about probing and language,You have shown that objects are determined by their probe responses. I wonder: might words be similarly determined by their contextual responses? A word probed by different grammatical contexts reveals its meaning.,none,probing_language_connection,curious,strand_connection_established,CML-CORR-003
CML-L-004,961-05-18,pelleth_strand,corren_moll,capital_archives,western_archive,Probing insight applied to language,Your intuition is sound. If meaning is determined by context then meaning IS the complete probe-response profile. The Yoneda perspective applies: a word is nothing more than how it relates to all other words.,CML-L-003,yoneda_for_language,analytical,strand_endorsement,CML-CORR-004
CML-L-005,965-02-28,corren_moll,little_porn,western_archive,hilly_dale,Request for LPN documentation,I have studied your naming system from afar. Your LPN demonstrates that language can be systematized categorically. Would you share your notation principles? I believe they illuminate the structure of all language.,none,lpn_inquiry,respectful,lpn_documentation_request,CML-CORR-005
CML-L-006,965-04-15,little_porn,corren_moll,hilly_dale,western_archive,LPN principles shared,The names are not arbitrary. Each shape maps to sound through the shape of the mouth making it. But I was seven when I made this. You are finding something deeper—that ALL naming has structure.,CML-L-005,lpn_foundations,reflective,little_porn_validates_extension,CML-CORR-006
CML-L-007,968-09-05,corren_moll,pelleth_strand,western_archive,capital_archives,Distributional hypothesis announced,I have formalized my insight. Meaning is a FUNCTOR from the category of grammar to the category of reference. Words with similar grammatical contexts have similar meanings because the functor preserves structure.,none,distributional_functor,excited,major_theoretical_announcement,CML-CORR-007
CML-L-008,968-11-20,pelleth_strand,corren_moll,capital_archives,western_archive,Response to distributional hypothesis,You have discovered something important. Your functor is the linguistic analogue of my Yoneda embedding. Where I show objects are determined by all morphisms TO them you show words are determined by all morphisms FROM them.,CML-L-007,yoneda_distributional_parallel,impressed,theoretical_synthesis,CML-CORR-008
CML-L-009,970-03-12,corren_moll,brennet_kell,western_archive,bureau_computational,Early correspondence with Kell,Your work at the Bureau interests me. If meaning is distributional and computation can track distributions then machines might learn meaning through context alone.,none,computational_linguistics_preview,speculative,early_kell_connection,CML-CORR-009
CML-L-010,970-07-08,brennet_kell,corren_moll,bureau_computational,western_archive,Kell responds on computation,Your distributional functor could be approximated computationally. If we weight each contextual morphism and sum across many examples the result might capture something of meaning itself.,CML-L-009,weighted_contexts,analytical,foreshadows_attention,CML-CORR-010
CML-L-011,975-12-10,corren_moll,sareth_moll,western_archive,capital,On the Category of Language completed,I have finished my treatise. The category of language is now formalized. Thank you cousin for showing me that persistence is relational. Words persist through usage as ghosts persist through memory.,none,manuscript_completion,grateful,treatise_announcement,CML-CORR-011
CML-L-012,976-02-15,sareth_moll,corren_moll,capital,western_archive,Congratulations and reflection,Your work honors our family name. We Molls seem drawn to how things persist—I through substrate you through context. Perhaps persistence is the deepest category of all.,CML-L-011,family_legacy,warm,family_connection,CML-CORR-012
CML-L-013,980-05-20,corren_moll,brennet_kell,western_archive,bureau_computational,On attention and context,I read your notes on weighted passages. You weight morphisms by relevance to a query. This is precisely what context does in language—it weighs which relations matter for meaning.,none,attention_as_context,collaborative,attention_connection,CML-CORR-013
CML-L-014,980-09-15,brennet_kell,corren_moll,bureau_computational,western_archive,Attention as distributional weighting,You see it clearly. My attention mechanism IS your distributional hypothesis in computational form. Query-key-value is just asking: which contexts matter for this word in this position?,CML-L-013,attention_distributional_equivalence,excited,major_theoretical_synthesis,CML-CORR-014
CML-L-015,990-06-30,corren_moll,pelleth_strand,western_archive,capital_archives,Linguistic Functors completed,My second treatise is done. The embedding functor is now fully specified. A word's meaning vector is exactly its distributional profile—the functor value of the word-object under the meaning functor.,none,second_manuscript_completion,satisfied,definitive_work_announced,CML-CORR-015
CML-L-016,990-08-22,pelleth_strand,corren_moll,capital_archives,western_archive,Final theoretical harmony,Your linguistic functor and my probing lemma are two views of the same truth. Objects are determined by relations. Words are determined by contexts. Meaning is structure all the way down.,CML-L-015,ultimate_synthesis,philosophical,final_synthesis,CML-CORR-016
CML-L-017,994-11-30,corren_moll,sareth_moll,western_archive,capital,Final letter to cousin,I grow old cousin. But I am content. You taught me that patterns persist through their relations. I showed that words work the same way. The Moll family contribution to Densworld thought is now complete.,none,farewell_reflection,peaceful,final_correspondence,CML-CORR-017
