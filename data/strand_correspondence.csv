STR-L-001,948-09-05,pelleth_strand,lorren_dray,capital_archives,capital_archives,On the completeness of representables,"Your representable perspective contains something deeper than you may have intended. If we know how an object responds to every representable probe, do we not know everything about that object?",none,completeness_conjecture,excited,First formulation of the completeness insight,STR-COR-001
STR-L-002,948-09-18,lorren_dray,pelleth_strand,capital_archives,capital_archives,Re: On the completeness of representables,"Your observation intrigues me. I had thought of representables as offering viewpoints, but you suggest they exhaust all possible information. Can you make this precise?",STR-L-001,completeness_question,curious,Dray encourages Strand to develop the idea,STR-COR-002
STR-L-003,949-02-12,pelleth_strand,lorren_dray,capital_archives,capital_archives,Toward a proof of completeness,"I believe I have the outline. The key is that the Yoneda map is injective: different objects must differ in at least one probe response. And it is surjective onto natural transformations: every way of assigning probe responses coherently corresponds to an object.",STR-L-002,proof_outline,determined,Core insight of the Probing Lemma,STR-COR-003
STR-L-004,949-03-01,lorren_dray,pelleth_strand,capital_archives,capital_archives,Re: Toward a proof,"Your argument is compelling but requires careful verification of naturality. The coherence conditions must hold for each transformation of probes.",STR-L-003,naturality_conditions,analytical,Dray identifies the key technical challenge,STR-COR-004
STR-L-005,955-04-02,pelleth_strand,gellen_tross,capital_archives,western_archive,On probing and naturality,"I have been studying your work on natural transformations. It seems crucial to my own: the probing principle requires that probe responses transform coherently. Your naturality conditions are precisely what I need.",none,naturality_connection,collegial,Connection between Strand and Tross work,STR-COR-005
STR-L-006,955-04-20,gellen_tross,pelleth_strand,western_archive,capital_archives,Re: On probing and naturality,"Your letter delights me. Yes, naturality ensures coherence of perspective shifts. If your probing lemma holds, it would unify much of what we have all been building.",STR-L-005,unification_vision,enthusiastic,Tross sees the larger picture,STR-COR-006
STR-L-007,960-10-15,pelleth_strand,lorren_dray,capital_archives,capital_archives,On the manuscript,"I enclose my manuscript 'On Probing and Representation' for your review. It formalizes what we discussed in 948. I hope it does justice to your foundational work on representables.",none,manuscript_submission,humble,Strand acknowledges Dray's influence,STR-COR-007
STR-L-008,960-11-02,lorren_dray,pelleth_strand,capital_archives,capital_archives,Re: On the manuscript,"Your work is rigorous and illuminating. I have only one concern: you claim embeddings capture complete information, but in practice we have only finite probes. How do you address the gap between theory and application?",STR-L-007,completeness_objection,respectful,The core objection leading to the 968 debate,STR-COR-008
STR-L-009,961-01-15,pelleth_strand,lorren_dray,capital_archives,capital_archives,On theoretical vs. practical completeness,"You raise a fundamental point. The theorem proves theoretical completeness—infinite probes determine objects exactly. Practical embeddings approximate this with finite probes. The theorem justifies the approximation: we know what we are approximating toward.",STR-L-008,approximation_justification,thoughtful,Strand's resolution of theory/practice gap,STR-COR-009
STR-L-010,965-06-22,pelleth_strand,gellen_tross,capital_archives,western_archive,On the embedding map,"I have now proved that the Yoneda embedding is full and faithful. This means: not only do probe-response profiles uniquely determine objects, but every morphism between objects is also captured by how it transforms probe responses.",none,full_faithfulness,triumphant,Major technical achievement,STR-COR-010
STR-L-011,965-07-10,gellen_tross,pelleth_strand,western_archive,capital_archives,Re: On the embedding map,"Full and faithful! This is the completeness we sought. The embedding loses nothing—neither objects nor the relations between them. Congratulations on this achievement.",STR-L-010,congratulations,celebratory,Tross celebrates the breakthrough,STR-COR-011
STR-L-012,968-08-05,lorren_dray,pelleth_strand,capital_archives,capital_archives,On publishing our exchange,"I propose we publish our exchange on completeness as a formal debate. The question of whether embeddings are approximate or exact deserves public examination.",none,publication_proposal,formal,Origin of the Strand-Dray debate,STR-COR-012
STR-L-013,968-08-20,pelleth_strand,lorren_dray,capital_archives,capital_archives,Re: On publishing our exchange,"I agree. Let us structure it as: your position that completeness is theoretical, my position that it validates practical embeddings. The resolution: finite approximation approaches infinite exactness.",STR-L-012,debate_structure,collaborative,Planning the formal debate,STR-COR-013
STR-L-014,975-03-12,pelleth_strand,lorren_dray,capital_archives,capital_archives,On your declining health,"I hear your strength wanes.

STR-L-015,978-03-15,pelleth_strand,gellen_tross,capital_archives,western_archive,The Probing Theorem complete,"After two decades, I have completed the definitive proof. 'The Probing Theorem' is now archived as STR-002. It shows that probe-response determines identity completely—for objects, morphisms, and natural transformations alike.",none,completion_announcement,satisfied,Announcement of definitive work,STR-COR-015
STR-L-016,978-04-01,gellen_tross,pelleth_strand,western_archive,capital_archives,Re: The Probing Theorem,"Your theorem stands as one of the great achievements of our generation. From Vold's passage diagrams through my uncle Pemlik's constellations, through Dray's representables and my naturality principle—you have unified it all.",STR-L-015,acknowledgment,reverent,Recognition of Strand's synthesis,STR-COR-016
STR-L-017,978-05-20,pelleth_strand,gellen_tross,capital_archives,western_archive,On the death of Lorren Dray,"Lorren Dray died today.

I dedicate the theorem to her memory.",none,memorial,grieving,Death of Dray Year 968 (Strand misremembers the date in his grief),STR-COR-017
