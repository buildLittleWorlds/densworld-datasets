MC-001,720-03-18,Kelleth Mund,Classification Integrity Committee,collapse_aftermath,Great Collapse Records,urgent,The archive has witnessed what happens when categories reference themselves. We must find the formal principle that prevents this.,foundational,First letter proposing systematic solution
MC-002,720-04-02,Torrel Goss,Kelleth Mund,committee_invitation,none,collegial,Your insights during the collapse were invaluable. We invite you to join the Classification Integrity Committee.,notable,Invitation to join the committee
MC-003,720-05-15,Kelleth Mund,Torrel Goss,acceptance,none,collegial,I accept with the understanding that we must pursue formal methods not mere procedural fixes.,notable,Mund joins the committee
MC-004,721-02-08,Kelleth Mund,Menna Krey,early_theory,none,reflective,What if the problem is not the documents but our notion of objects? What if there are only passages?,breakthrough,First hint of passage calculus
MC-005,721-06-22,Menna Krey,Kelleth Mund,skepticism,none,argumentative,Passages without objects? But surely a document must BE something before it can DO something.,routine,Early pushback on Mund's ideas
MC-006,721-09-14,Kelleth Mund,Menna Krey,clarification,none,reflective,Consider: a document's identity IS its function. What it does when accessed defines what it is.,notable,Key insight refined
MC-007,722-01-03,Kelleth Mund,Classification Integrity Committee,theory_proposal,On the Reduction of Structure,collegial,I present for your consideration a formal calculus in which all structure reduces to pure passages.,foundational,The Pure Passage Calculus proposed
MC-008,722-03-20,Torrel Goss,Kelleth Mund,initial_reception,On the Reduction of Structure,collegial,Your proposal is elegant but I confess I do not see how it prevents the collapse patterns we witnessed.,routine,Committee's initial hesitation
MC-009,722-08-11,Kelleth Mund,Torrel Goss,demonstration,On the Reduction of Structure,reflective,The collapse occurred because objects could reference themselves. In pure passages self-reference has a different character.,notable,Explaining the distinction
MC-010,723-02-15,Kelleth Mund,Archive Director,formal_presentation,On the Reduction of Structure,collegial,I request an audience to present the Pure Passage Calculus to the Archive's senior scholars.,routine,Seeking wider audience

MC-012,724-01-22,Torrel Goss,Kelleth Mund,opposition_warning,none,urgent,Be warned that Councilor Dorren considers your ideas dangerous. He fears you would destabilize the archive further.,notable,Political opposition emerges
MC-013,724-04-18,Kelleth Mund,Torrel Goss,response_to_warning,none,reflective,Let Dorren fear. The truth of formal structure does not bend to political convenience.,routine,Mund's defiance
MC-014,724-07-03,Councilor Dorren,Kelleth Mund,formal_objection,none,argumentative,Your so-called calculus would reduce the Archive's sacred documents to mere mechanical operations. This is unacceptable.,notable,Direct confrontation begins
MC-015,724-09-28,Kelleth Mund,Councilor Dorren,defense,Against Objects,argumentative,I reduce nothing sacred. I reveal the formal structure that was always present. Understanding prevents collapse.,notable,Mund's philosophical defense
MC-016,725-01-14,Kelleth Mund,Archive Director,manuscript_submission,Against Objects,collegial,I submit for the Archive's collection my treatise Against Objects which clarifies the philosophical foundations.,notable,Major work submitted
MC-017,725-04-22,Jorell Vance,Kelleth Mund,introduction,none,collegial,I am a young scholar interested in your passage calculus. Might we correspond on matters of formal structure?,notable,First contact with Vance
MC-018,725-07-09,Kelleth Mund,Jorell Vance,welcome,none,collegial,Your questions are perceptive. I welcome correspondence with a mind willing to think rigorously about foundations.,routine,Mund welcomes Vance
MC-019,726-02-18,Jorell Vance,Kelleth Mund,naming_question,none,reflective,Your passages use names - variables like x and y. But are names essential? Could we eliminate them entirely?,breakthrough,Vance's key insight
MC-020,726-05-03,Kelleth Mund,Jorell Vance,surprised_response,none,reflective,Eliminate names? An intriguing question. I have always taken bound variables as primitive. What would replace them?,notable,Mund considers Vance's challenge
MC-021,726-09-22,Jorell Vance,Kelleth Mund,combinator_hint,none,reflective,What if we had only three primitive passages? One that discards one that distributes one that identifies?,breakthrough,First sketch of SKI combinators
MC-022,727-03-15,Kelleth Mund,Jorell Vance,encouragement,none,collegial,Pursue this line of thought. If you can show names are eliminable it would deepen our understanding greatly.,notable,Mund encourages Vance
MC-023,731-02-08,Kelleth Mund,Classification Integrity Committee,treatise_announcement,The Passage Calculus,collegial,After years of refinement I present my complete treatise The Passage Calculus.,foundational,Major treatise completed
MC-024,735-06-14,Archive Director,Kelleth Mund,promotion,none,collegial,In recognition of your contributions you are promoted to Senior Logician of the Classification Integrity Committee.,notable,Mund's promotion
MC-025,738-01-22,Kelleth Mund,Jorell Vance,numeral_discovery,On Church Numerals,reflective,I have found that the natural numbers can be encoded as pure passages. Zero is the passage that does nothing.,breakthrough,Church numerals discovered
MC-026,738-04-09,Jorell Vance,Kelleth Mund,numeral_response,none,collegial,Your numeral encoding is beautiful. The number three IS the passage that applies something three times.,routine,Vance's appreciation
MC-027,738-07-18,Kelleth Mund,Jorell Vance,boolean_extension,On Church Numerals,reflective,Similarly TRUE and FALSE can be encoded. TRUE returns its first argument FALSE returns its second.,notable,Boolean encoding
MC-028,741-03-05,Kelleth Mund,Menna Krey,logic_encoding,On Boolean Passages,collegial,I can now encode all of propositional logic within the passage calculus. AND OR NOT - all are passages.,notable,Logic fully encoded
MC-029,742-11-22,Kelleth Mund,Jorell Vance,pairs_encoding,On Passage Pairs,reflective,Even structured data - pairs lists - can be encoded. A pair is a passage awaiting its selector.,notable,Data structures encoded
MC-030,745-01-08,Jorell Vance,Kelleth Mund,combinator_proposal,On Combinatorial Reduction,collegial,I have completed my alternative. Three combinators - S K I - suffice for all computation. Names are unnecessary.,foundational,SKI combinators proposed
MC-031,745-04-22,Kelleth Mund,Jorell Vance,combinator_response,On Combinatorial Reduction,reflective,Your achievement is remarkable. Yet I wonder if the elimination of names comes at a cost in clarity.,notable,Mund's measured response
MC-032,746-02-17,Jorell Vance,Kelleth Mund,clarity_defense,none,argumentative,Clarity is subjective. Formal simplicity is not. Three primitives are objectively simpler than infinitely many names.,notable,Vance defends combinators
MC-033,747-06-03,Classification Integrity Committee,Archive Director,debate_announcement,Mund-Vance Debate,collegial,We announce a formal debate between Senior Logician Mund and Scholar Vance on the foundations of passage theory.,notable,The great debate announced
MC-034,747-09-18,Kelleth Mund,Jorell Vance,pre_debate,none,collegial,Though we shall debate publicly I hope our disagreement remains in the realm of ideas not persons.,routine,Collegial pre-debate message
MC-035,747-09-20,Jorell Vance,Kelleth Mund,pre_debate_response,none,collegial,Agreed. We seek truth not victory. May the debate illuminate rather than obscure.,routine,Vance's collegial response
MC-036,747-12-05,Kelleth Mund,Jorell Vance,post_debate,none,reflective,Our debate revealed that both approaches have merit. Perhaps they are two views of the same structure.,breakthrough,Post-debate synthesis begins
MC-037,752-03-14,Kelleth Mund,Classification Integrity Committee,fixed_point_warning,On Self-Reference,urgent,I have discovered passages that reduce to themselves indefinitely. This is the formal echo of the Great Collapse.,foundational,Fixed point discovery
MC-038,752-06-22,Torrel Goss,Kelleth Mund,fixed_point_concern,none,urgent,Your omega passage disturbs me. Have you recreated the collapse in miniature?,notable,Committee concern
MC-039,752-09-08,Kelleth Mund,Torrel Goss,fixed_point_defense,none,reflective,Understanding the danger is not creating the danger. Now we know what to avoid - self-application.,notable,Mund's defense
MC-040,753-02-18,Kelleth Mund,Jorell Vance,Y_combinator,On Self-Reference,reflective,I have found a passage that enables controlled recursion without infinite regress - the Y combinator.,breakthrough,Y combinator discovered
MC-041,755-07-03,Kelleth Mund,Brennis Mund,family_introduction,none,collegial,My dear nephew you show aptitude for formal reasoning. Would you study the passage calculus with me?,notable,Brennis introduced
MC-042,758-04-22,Kelleth Mund,Archive Director,paradoxes_manuscript,Paradoxes of Self-Application,reflective,I submit my analysis of self-referential passages. These are dangerous but understanding them is necessary.,notable,Major work on paradoxes

MC-044,765-08-09,Brennis Mund,Kelleth Mund,student_question,none,reflective,Uncle your system allows passages that never terminate. Is this not a flaw to be corrected?,breakthrough,Brennis questions non-termination
MC-045,766-02-22,Kelleth Mund,Brennis Mund,student_response,none,reflective,Non-termination is not a flaw but a feature. Some questions have no finite answer. Our calculus reflects this truth.,notable,Mund defends non-termination
MC-046,768-03-18,Marden Krey,Kelleth Mund,consistency_challenge,On Consistency,argumentative,Your calculus allows contradictions. Any passage can be shown to equal any other. This is unacceptable.,notable,Krey's consistency challenge
MC-047,768-06-05,Kelleth Mund,Marden Krey,consistency_response,none,reflective,You confuse the calculus with its typing discipline. The untyped calculus is indeed permissive. Types will constrain it.,notable,Mund hints at types
MC-048,775-01-12,Kelleth Mund,Classification Integrity Committee,limits_manuscript,Passages and Their Limits,reflective,I present my analysis of what the passage calculus can and cannot express. Every formal system has limits.,notable,Mature philosophical work
MC-049,780-04-08,Kelleth Mund,Brennis Mund,succession,none,collegial,You are ready to join the Committee. Your fresh perspective will advance our work beyond what I have achieved.,notable,Brennis appointed
MC-050,785-02-22,Brennis Mund,Kelleth Mund,typed_proposal,none,reflective,Uncle what if we added boundaries - types - that prevent certain passages from combining with certain others?,breakthrough,Typed passages proposed
MC-051,785-05-14,Kelleth Mund,Brennis Mund,typed_response,none,reflective,Types would prevent non-termination but at what cost? Would we lose the passages that compute recursively?,notable,Mund's concerns about types
MC-052,785-09-03,Classification Integrity Committee,Archive Director,generational_debate,Generational Debate on Types,collegial,We announce a debate between Director Mund and Scholar Brennis Mund on the question of typed passages.,notable,Generational debate announced
MC-053,790-01-18,Kelleth Mund,Brennis Mund,late_reflections,none,reflective,As I age I wonder if my pure system was too pure. Perhaps types are necessary after all.,notable,Mund's late-life doubt
MC-054,792-03-05,Kelleth Mund,Archive Director,retirement,Retirement Notes,collegial,After seventy-two years of service I request permission to retire from the Committee.,routine,Retirement request
