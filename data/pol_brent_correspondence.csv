The timing is precise—not approximate, but exact.",FL-001,stakdur,Yeller Quarry,Brent reports first observation of five-phase pattern in stakdur.
PB-002,892-04-02,pol,brent,Library hypothesis,pattern theory,foundational,"What if the pattern preceded the creature? What if the stakdur did not invent this cycle but found it?",FL-001,stakdur,Form Library (theoretical),Pol proposes the Library of Forms hypothesis for the first time.
PB-003,892-05-18,brent,pol,Reed-spinner observation,convergent pattern,breakthrough,"The reed-spinners show the same pattern. The same five phases. The same prime intervals.

PB-016,896-06-15,pol,brent,Stability gradient,Dens proximity,theoretical,"Forms near the Dens are unstable. The barrier thins. What elsewhere requires a body to read there reads itself.",FL-007 FL-022,multiple,Dens region,Pol proposes Dens-stability relationship.
PB-017,897-01-08,brent,pol,Dens expedition,boundary phenomena,observational,"You are right. Near the Dens the patterns break down. I observed forms flickering between states. Unstable.",FL-007 FL-016,spatial phenomena,Dens Perimeter,Brent confirms Dens instability.
PB-018,897-04-25,pol,brent,Unstable forms,chaos regions,theoretical,"These are not failures. They are where the Library opens directly. Unmediated access—dangerous but real.",FL-007 FL-016 FL-022,spatial phenomena,Dens,Pol theorizes on Dens phenomena.
PB-019,898-08-12,brent,pol,Human patterns,cultural forms,observational,"Even humans read from the Library. I found a village whose rituals follow the Quintic pattern. They do not know why.",FL-001,humans,Remote Village,Brent documents human cultural manifestation.
PB-020,899-02-28,pol,brent,Universal access,reader diversity,theoretical,"The Library does not discriminate. Any system capable of maintaining pattern can read. Bodies creatures places people.",multiple,multiple,Universal,Pol argues universal access to forms.
PB-021,900-06-10,brent,pol,Morphospace concept,mapping the Library,observational,"We need coordinates. A way to place forms in relation to each other. I propose three dimensions based on your categories.",multiple,multiple,Form Library,Brent proposes morphospace mapping system.
PB-022,901-03-15,pol,brent,Coordinate system,Library cartography,theoretical,"Yes. Stability complexity and basin membership. These three can locate any form. We can map the Library.",multiple,multiple,Form Library,Pol refines coordinate system.
PB-023,907-09-22,brent,pol,Scavenger testimony,meta-observation,breakthrough,"The Scavenger said: The forms were here before the creatures. The creatures just learned to read them. She knows.",multiple,Old Gritts (Scavenger),Unspecified,Brent reports Scavenger's testimony supporting Library.
PB-024,908-11-05,pol,brent,Testimony analysis,independent confirmation,theoretical,"An unlettered Scavenger arrives at the same conclusion through observation alone. The Library is not philosophy. It is fact.",multiple,Old Gritts,Form Library,Pol argues Scavenger testimony confirms theory.

PB-034,917-04-22,pol,brent,Eternal forms,stability limits,theoretical,"Some forms may be eternal. The Five-Body Form requires no maintenance—it simply is. Yeller did not learn it. Yeller is it.",FL-027,Yeller,Form Library,Pol theorizes on eternal forms.
