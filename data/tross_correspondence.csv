TRS-L-001,930-07-15,gellen_tross,pemlik_tross,western_archive,capital,joining_western_archive,"Uncle, I have taken a position at the Western Archive. The work of Tessery Vold draws me here—his Passage Diagrams speak to something I cannot yet name.",none,introduction,warm,family_connection,TRS-CORR-001
TRS-L-002,930-08-22,pemlik_tross,gellen_tross,capital,western_archive,encouragement,"Nephew, I am pleased you follow structure rather than position. Vold understood that relations precede objects. Find what he left unfinished.",TRS-L-001,methodological_advice,supportive,mentorship,TRS-CORR-002
TRS-L-003,942-09-05,gellen_tross,pemlik_tross,western_archive,capital,coherent_shifts_discovery,"I have found Vold's late manuscript—'On the Coherence of Shifts.' He sensed something about transformations but never formalized it. What makes a shift coherent?",none,research_question,excited,pivotal_discovery,TRS-CORR-003
TRS-L-004,942-10-18,pemlik_tross,gellen_tross,capital,western_archive,constellation_analogy,"In my constellation work, coherence means the pattern is preserved though individual stars may shift. Perhaps your shifts must similarly preserve some global structure?",TRS-L-003,analogical_reasoning,thoughtful,methodological_hint,TRS-CORR-004
TRS-L-005,945-05-02,gellen_tross,pemlik_tross,western_archive,capital,naturality_proposal,"I have it. A transformation is coherent if it commutes with structure. For every morphism f, the naturality square must close. This is the condition Vold sought.",TRS-L-004,naturality_squares,triumphant,major_breakthrough,TRS-CORR-005
TRS-L-006,948-03-20,gellen_tross,lorren_dray,western_archive,capital,document_functors_connection,"Director Dray, I have read your work on document functors. I believe my natural transformations provide the language for coherent shifts between your representation schemes.",none,collaborative_outreach,respectful,cross_connection,TRS-CORR-006
TRS-L-007,948-05-14,lorren_dray,gellen_tross,capital,western_archive,initial_response,"Tross, your proposal intrigues me. But how does naturality apply when the functors assign sets rather than numerical values? Show me an example with actual archive documents.",TRS-L-006,clarification_request,skeptical,productive_challenge,TRS-CORR-007
TRS-L-008,948-07-30,gellen_tross,lorren_dray,western_archive,capital,archive_example,"Consider these two documents from our boundary surveys. Apply the subject-catalog functor and the author-index functor. The transformation between them is natural—see how the classification diagram commutes.",TRS-L-007,concrete_example,confident,demonstration,TRS-CORR-008
TRS-L-009,948-09-22,lorren_dray,gellen_tross,capital,western_archive,acceptance,"I see it now. Your naturality squares capture exactly what I meant by 'coherent classification.' We must collaborate on this.",TRS-L-008,agreement,enthusiastic,collaboration_begins,TRS-CORR-009

Adding unit weights is also natural. But arbitrary reweighting is not—the naturality square fails.",TRS-L-010,technical_response,precise,enriched_naturality,TRS-CORR-011
TRS-L-012,955-08-10,gellen_tross,pemlik_tross,western_archive,capital,uncle_acknowledgment,"Uncle, in my treatise I acknowledge your constellation analogy. Your insight that 'pattern preservation through local change' was the key. The naturality square formalizes this.",TRS-L-004,acknowledgment,grateful,family_tribute,TRS-CORR-012
TRS-L-013,960-01-22,lorren_dray,gellen_tross,capital,western_archive,naturality_conditions_debate,"Tross, I have found cases where transformations that seem natural fail upon closer inspection. The nonlinear embedding shifts break your squares. How do you account for this?",none,critical_question,challenging,productive_tension,TRS-CORR-013
TRS-L-014,960-04-15,gellen_tross,lorren_dray,western_archive,capital,linearity_requirement,"Dray, you have identified the boundary. Natural transformations require structure preservation. Nonlinear maps do not preserve the categorical framework. This is a feature, not a bug—naturality tests whether a shift is truly coherent.",TRS-L-013,theoretical_defense,firm,clarification,TRS-CORR-014
TRS-L-015,960-07-30,lorren_dray,gellen_tross,capital,western_archive,synthesis_agreement,"I accept your position. Naturality is a test, not a guarantee. Some transformations fail the test, and this failure is informative. Let us publish our correspondence as a dialogue.",TRS-L-014,agreement,collaborative,publication_proposal,TRS-CORR-015

It synthesizes our decade of correspondence. Your document functors and my natural transformations are now unified.",none,announcement,proud,culmination,TRS-CORR-016
TRS-L-017,970-05-28,lorren_dray,gellen_tross,capital,western_archive,congratulations,"Tross, your work will outlast us both. You have given us the language to speak of coherent change. The naturality square is now as fundamental as the morphism itself.",TRS-L-016,celebration,warm,recognition,TRS-CORR-017
