STI-001,Three Schools of Memory,,Theoretical Framework,Memory/Cognition,"Multiple (Little Porn; The Mnemonist; Quonxy)",Historical,"Three contrasting approaches to memorization: (1) Little Porn's absolute correspondence - image/space for every word; (2) The Mnemonist's method - nature unclear; (3) Quonxy's purity approach - sounds/words for themselves.","Artbook Mnemonism; Puzzle Languages; Think-switches",,Medium,Indexer Voss,"Comparison framework. Three distinct mnemonic traditions documented."
STI-002,The Three-Compassed Maps,,Cosmological Framework,Cartography/Cosmology,Traditional,Ancient,"W1 maps operate with only three cardinal directions. No East exists in standard Densworld cartography. Fundamental cosmological difference from external frameworks.","Dens Mapping Principles; Proscribed Coordinates","Guild foundational documents",High,Indexer Moll,"Core cartographic constraint. East-absence not arbitrary but reflects W1 spatial structure."
STI-003,Binary Naturalism,,Observational Practice,Natural Philosophy,"Half Bad (materialist); Grit (spiritual)",Historical,"Practice of observing two-state (binary) mechanisms in nature. Two versions: Half Bad observes on/off present/absent states materialistically; Grit prays 'on the blink' and assigns ones/zeros spiritually.","N-state Objects",,Low,Indexer Voss,"Dual tradition. Materialist and spiritual approaches to same binary observation."
STI-004,Familiars,,Supernatural Concept,Metaphysics/Creature Studies,Folk tradition,Traditional,"'The form of a living thing that follows the witch after its death.' Post-mortem companion creatures associated with witch practitioners.","Creature Grammar; Yeller studies",,Low,Indexer Queever,"Supernatural category. Not suitable for standard taxonomic classification."

STI-006,Kindling Metaphysics,,Philosophical Framework,Philosophy/Metaphysics,Unknown,Historical,"Fire → kindling → fire cycle. Philosophical exploration of the relationship between consuming and fueling. Core W1 metaphysical concept.","Densmuck materials",,Medium,Indexer Vell,"Foundational metaphysical framework. Connects to material cycle concepts."
STI-007,Privacy / The Inner,,Philosophical Concept,Philosophy/Consciousness,Unknown,Historical,"Exploration of interiority. Question: 'What if there were no such thing as the inner?'

What happens when all thoughts become public."

Essential for Dens navigation and trade."
STI-009,Deep Dens,,Geographic/Metaphysical Zone,Dens Studies,Traditional,Traditional,"Zone below Dens surface. The shelf under villages. Subterranean lake. Where creatures and dangers dwell. No surveyor returns from deep penetration.","Densmuck materials; Coordinate Mortality","Proscribed Coordinates (Appendix D)",High,Indexer Pol,"Unmappable zone. Principle of Selective Blindness applies. Data gaps intentional."
STI-010,N-state Objects,,Classification System,Object Theory,Unknown,Historical,"Objects classified by number of possible states: 2-state through 12-state complexity. Higher N indicates greater behavioral complexity.","Binary Naturalism",,Low,Indexer Voss,"Object classification framework. Relates to binary naturalism as special case (N=2)."

STI-012,Pre-linguistic / Post-linguistic zones,,Spatial Classification,Dens Studies/Philosophy,Unknown,Historical,"Division of W1 space by linguistic character: The Dens represents 'pre-linguistic' zone; Tower-desert represents 'post-linguistic' zone. Language itself has geography.","Privacy / The Inner; Deep Dens",,Medium,Indexer Vell,"Spatial-linguistic framework. Dens defies language; desert-tower operates through it."
STI-013,Stone School vs Water School,,Taxonomic Debate,Creature Studies/Philosophy,"Multiple (Renna Caw - Water)",Historical,"Methodological schism in creature taxonomy. Stone School emphasizes fixed classification; Water School (Renna Caw) emphasizes fluid boundaries and transformation.","Creature Grammar; Binary Naturalism",,Low,Indexer Molk,"Taxonomic methodological debate. Parallels retrieval vs geometric math schism."
STI-014,Pebble School,,Taxonomic Approach,Creature Studies,"Unknown (minor school)",Historical,"Third position in taxonomic debate. Between Stone and Water schools. Emphasizes gradual change within stable categories.","Stone School; Water School",,Very Low,Indexer Molk,"Minor school. Compromise position. Few adherents documented."
