TR-001,1849-11-15,Unna Krehl,Moat Engineer,Moat failure analysis,commission,The moat worked when we treated it as a negotiation. It failed when we tried to dominate.,"The moat worked. I want to be clear about that. The moat worked. What didn't work was everything that came after. We started with a truce and ended with a war.",high
TR-002,1849-11-22,Unna Krehl,Moat Engineer,Institutional failure,commission,The institution forgot what the moat was for.,"The moat was an engineering project. It became an institution. And the institution became a way of thinking that forgot what the moat was for.",high
TR-003,1849-12-05,Kell,Senior Surveyor,SW deterioration,commission,I warned them for three years. They filed my reports and funded more construction.,"Every season I documented the patterns. Every season they asked for more moat. By Year 1847 I stopped expecting anyone to listen.",high
TR-004,1849-12-12,Kell,Senior Surveyor,Surveyor breakdowns,commission,We lost good surveyors because the institution demanded certainty where none existed.,"The dens doesn't care about our categories. We tried to make it care. That's what broke us.",high
TR-005,1850-01-10,Senator Krehl,Former Interventionist Leader,Policy decisions,commission,We believed we were protecting people. We were wrong about how protection works.,"I stand by every vote. I was trying to protect the settlements. What I understand now is that protection and control are not the same thing.",moderate
TR-006,1850-01-18,Senator Gast,Reformist Leader,Alternative approaches,commission,We proposed research instead of reinforcement. They called it defeatism.,"The reformist proposals were not about giving up. They were about understanding before acting. But the Senate wanted action.",high
TR-007,1850-02-05,Prebel,Independent Researcher,Non-containment methods,commission,The boundary responds to approach. Aggression begets aggression.,"What I observed at the northern sector convinced me. The dens knows when it's being attacked. It responds in kind.",high
TR-008,1850-02-15,Prebel,Independent Researcher,Coexistence possibility,commission,We don't have to fight the boundary. We can negotiate with it.,"Yeller survived not by building walls but by letting them down. The entity understood something we refused to learn.",high
TR-009,1850-03-01,Former Surveyor A,Survey Office,Working conditions,commission,They pushed us past breaking. Then they blamed us for breaking.,"We were asked to document the unknowable. When we said it couldn't be done the way they wanted they replaced us with people who would lie.",moderate
TR-010,1850-03-08,Former Surveyor B,Survey Office,Data manipulation,commission,The reports were edited before they reached the Senate.,"My original observations showed retreat patterns. What reached the committee showed containment success. I don't know who changed them.",moderate
TR-011,1850-03-15,Refugee Leader A,SW Settlement,Evacuation experience,commission,They gave us three days to leave everything behind.,We built those homes. Our families had been there for generations. Three days notice.,high
TR-012,1850-03-22,Refugee Leader B,SW Settlement,Settlement policy,commission,The resettlement camps were punishment for living in the wrong place.,We didn't choose to live near the dens. Our ancestors were there before anyone knew what the dens was.,high
TR-013,1850-04-01,Moat Authority Official,Administration,Resource allocation,commission,We were never adequately funded for the mission we were given.,"The Senate voted for goals. They didn't vote for reality. We were asked to contain the unknowable with inadequate resources.",low
TR-014,1850-04-08,Moat Authority Official,Administration,Decision making,commission,We followed the protocols we were given.,Every decision was documented. Every action was authorized. If the outcome was bad the protocols were bad.,low
TR-015,1850-04-15,Senator Vorn,Traditionalist,Pre-crisis period,commission,We followed established methods. The crisis came anyway.,"The traditionalist position was never that we knew everything. It was that we should proceed carefully. The interventionists wanted speed.",moderate
TR-016,1850-04-22,Senator Trell,Traditionalist,Surveyor concerns,commission,The surveyors told us what was happening. We debated instead of acting.,"I regret every session where we discussed procedures instead of listening to the people on the ground.",high
TR-017,1850-05-01,Independent Scholar,Academy,Historical precedent,commission,There is no precedent for what the Senate attempted.,"The historical record shows no successful containment of a dens boundary. The Senate attempted the impossible and are surprised they failed.",high
TR-018,1850-05-10,Independent Scholar,Academy,Policy analysis,commission,The policies accelerated the collapse they were designed to prevent.,"Each intervention provoked a response. Each response justified more intervention. The cycle was self-reinforcing.",high
TR-019,1850-05-20,Archive Researcher,Historical Records,Documentation gaps,commission,Key records from 1847-1849 are missing or incomplete.,"Whether by accident or design we cannot reconstruct the full decision chain. Critical documents are not in the archives.",moderate
TR-020,1850-06-01,Former Moat Worker,Construction,Working conditions,commission,We knew the moat wasn't working. We built it anyway.,"The engineers told us where to dig. We dug. When the ground started bleeding we kept digging because those were the orders.",moderate
TR-021,1850-06-10,Medical Officer,Health Services,Surveyor casualties,commission,The psychological toll was predictable and preventable.,"Prolonged exposure to boundary phenomena causes documented cognitive effects. We reported this. The rotations were too slow.",high
TR-022,1850-06-20,Medical Officer,Health Services,Refugee health,commission,The refugee population suffered from preventable conditions.,"Inadequate shelter inadequate food inadequate sanitation. These are policy failures not natural disasters.",high
TR-023,1850-07-01,Boundary Scholar,Academy,Dens behavior,commission,The dens is not malevolent. It responds to stimuli.,"What the Senate called aggression I would call response. Push and the dens pushes back. The moat was pushing.",high
TR-024,1850-07-10,Boundary Scholar,Academy,Containment theory,commission,Containment assumes the thing contained is static. The dens is not static.,"Every containment strategy assumed a fixed boundary. The boundary moves. The strategies were built on a false premise.",high
TR-025,1850-07-20,Former Senator,Legislature,Political pressure,commission,We voted for what was popular not what was wise.,"The interventionist position was emotionally satisfying. Doing something felt better than understanding something.",moderate
TR-026,1850-08-01,Yeller Quarry Worker,Mining,Yeller observations,commission,Yeller never attacked the moat. The moat attacked the boundary.,"I worked the quarry for fifteen years. Yeller was always there. The trouble started when the moat reached the southwest not before.",moderate
TR-027,1850-08-10,Community Elder,SW Settlement,Pre-crisis life,commission,We lived with the boundary for generations. The Senate decided we were doing it wrong.,"My grandmother knew how to read the boundary. She taught my mother who taught me. The surveyors came with instruments and called our knowledge superstition.",high
TR-028,1850-08-20,Community Elder,SW Settlement,Traditional knowledge,commission,The old ways worked because they were based on respect not control.,"You don't contain the dens. You negotiate with it. The Senate wanted certainty. The boundary doesn't offer certainty.",high
TR-029,1850-09-01,Engineering Consultant,External,Moat design,commission,The design was sound. The premise was not.,"I reviewed the engineering specifications. They were correct for the problem as stated. The problem was stated incorrectly.",moderate
TR-030,1850-09-10,Engineering Consultant,External,Alternative designs,commission,We proposed adaptive designs. They were rejected as impractical.,"Flexible boundaries that could respond to dens movement. The Authority wanted permanent solutions. Nothing about the dens is permanent.",moderate
TR-031,1850-09-20,Survey Office Director,Administration,Organizational failure,commission,The Office was asked to serve contradictory masters.,"The Senate wanted accurate data. The Authority wanted useful data. These were not the same thing. We tried to provide both and failed at both.",moderate
TR-032,1850-10-01,Survey Office Director,Administration,Staff morale,commission,Good surveyors left. Compliant surveyors stayed.,"The institutional pressure filtered for obedience not competence. By Year 1848 the best observers had resigned.",moderate
TR-033,1850-10-10,Refugee Advocate,Civil Society,Settlement conditions,commission,The camps were designed for weeks. People lived there for years.,"Emergency housing became permanent housing. Emergency rations became permanent diet. No one planned for the crisis to last.",high
TR-034,1850-10-20,Refugee Advocate,Civil Society,Integration failures,commission,The refugees were treated as problems not people.,"Policy discussions centered on managing the refugee population. Not on helping them rebuild. Managing. Like inventory.",high
TR-035,1850-11-01,Commission Chair,Investigation,Preliminary findings,commission,The evidence suggests systemic rather than individual failure.,"No single decision caused the collapse. The collapse emerged from a system that could not question its own assumptions.",high
TR-036,1850-11-10,Commission Chair,Investigation,Recommendations,commission,Fundamental reform of boundary policy is necessary.,"Incremental adjustment will not address the structural problems we have identified. The entire framework requires reconsideration.",high
TR-037,1851-02-01,Prebel,Independent Researcher,Northern sector success,commission,The northern approach proves alternatives exist.,"For two years we have maintained stable boundary relations without containment infrastructure. The evidence is clear.",high
TR-038,1851-03-01,Senator Krehl,Former Interventionist,Personal reflection,commission,I was wrong. Not about wanting to protect people. About how protection works.,"Looking back I see how each reasonable step led to unreasonable outcomes. The path was paved with good intentions.",moderate
TR-039,1851-04-01,Unna Krehl,Moat Engineer,Final testimony,commission,The dens stopped negotiating because we stopped offering anything except force.,"In the early years we listened to the boundary. We adapted. Then we decided we knew better. The boundary remembered even when we forgot.",high
TR-040,1851-05-01,Commission Chair,Investigation,Final report,commission,The collapse was preventable. The prevention would have required questioning foundational assumptions.,"Our conclusion: the institutional framework made the collapse more likely by preventing the learning that could have prevented it.",high
