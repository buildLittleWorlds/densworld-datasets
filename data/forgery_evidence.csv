MS-0156,high,"Uses 'dissolution' 14 times (Grigsu never used this term); 'residue' appears 8 times (water-school terminology); average sentence length 28.4 words (Grigsu averaged 18.2); function word pattern matches Mink's verified works at 0.89 correlation","References the Third Surveying Expedition (EXP-007) outcomes that occurred after supposed composition date; mentions Dannkit's testimony about Grigsu's final days which wasn't recorded until 891","Paper stock consistent with 890s manufacture not 860s; ink composition matches Mink's known correspondence; binding style post-dates Grigsu's death","Mink Pavar: discredits stone-school; damages Grigsu's legacy; supports Mink's historical narrative in MS-0044 and MS-0099","Strong candidate for forgery. Stylometric analysis clusters with Mink's verified works not Grigsu's. Mara Yent's notes (MS-0048) identified similar concerns before her death. The kachot dispute of 886 (DEB-12) provides motive."
MS-0157,high,"'Dissolution' appears 11 times; 'absorbed' 7 times; vocabulary overlap with Yasho's works at 67% (Grigsu-Yasho overlap typically 34%); rhetorical structure follows water-school conventions","Claims to respond to arguments Yasho made in MS-0102 which was written 31 years after this manuscript's supposed date; references 'the seventy pools' using Mirado terminology Grigsu never employed","Same paper stock as MS-0156; marginalia in Mink's handwriting; catalog entry in Mink's hand","Mink Pavar: makes stone-school appear incoherent; suggests Grigsu secretly agreed with water-school","Almost certainly forged. Topic modeling places this document firmly in water-school cluster despite stone-school attribution. Sentence rhythm analysis shows 0.91 correlation with Mink's writings."
MS-0158,confirmed,"Opens with 'I have been in error' - Grigsu never used first person in treatises; vocabulary shifts mid-document suggesting composite authorship; uses 'the lending of words' (pebble-school term Grigsu opposed)","Describes Grigsu witnessing the Ninth Expedition disaster (883) - Grigsu died in 891 but this manuscript supposedly written in 870; mentions Yasho's 'Final Refutations' (MS-0102) from 901","Different handwriting from other Grigsu manuscripts; paper watermark from Capital mill established 895; binding thread dyed with process invented 889","Mink Pavar: complete discrediting of stone-school; personal revenge for kachot dispute; supports his historical revisionism","Confirmed forgery. Multiple anachronisms impossible to explain. Physical evidence conclusive. Mink's motive documented in DEB-12 and subsequent correspondence. This is the smoking gun."
MS-0044,medium,"Selective quotation from Colonel Viragu's dispatches; omits passages unfavorable to water-school interpretation; 'dissolution' terminology applied anachronistically to military events","Claims Colonel Viragu supported water-school philosophy - his actual dispatches (MS-0061, MS-0062) show no such interest; dates of certain battles off by months","Original sources (MS-0061) show different wording than Mink's quotations; some 'quoted' passages do not appear in any known source","Mink Pavar: enhances his historical reputation; positions water-school as allied with military success","Not a forgery but a distortion. Mink selectively edited and misquoted sources. Cross-reference with original dispatches reveals systematic bias. Less serious than MS-0156-158 but part of pattern."
MS-0099,medium,"Characterizes stone-school decline in water-school terminology; quotes from MS-0156 and MS-0157 as though authentic; attributes statements to Grigsu that appear nowhere in verified works","Describes debates that have no corroborating witnesses; claims Grigsu made deathbed confession that contradicts Dannkit's account in MS-0088","Published after Mara Yent began questioning Mink's work; rushed to print based on binding quality","Mink Pavar: cements his version of history; preempts Mara Yent's investigation","Dependent on forged sources. If MS-0156-158 are forgeries, MS-0099's citations become evidence of Mink's knowledge of the forgeries. Circular confirmation of his narrative."
MS-0090,low,"Writing style inconsistent with known Densworld conventions; technical vocabulary anachronistic; some passages appear machine-translated","Game mechanics described post-date known invention dates; references to 'binary' predate common usage","Paper of unknown origin; ink chemistry unidentifiable; binding style not consistent with any known tradition","Unknown: possibly created to fill gap in Inventor documentation","Authenticity uncertain but not necessarily forged. May be genuine fragment transcribed or translated poorly. Not connected to Mink forgery cluster."
MS-0147,low,"Fragment too short for reliable stylometric analysis; vocabulary consistent with early Mirado texts; Jorkin paradox wording matches oral tradition","No clear anachronisms given uncertain composition date","Damage prevents physical analysis; remaining material consistent with ancient Mirado manufacture","Unknown: philosophical value regardless of authorship","Likely authentic ancient fragment. The Jorkin paradox is referenced in Bagbu's memoir (MS-0023) as existing tradition. Not connected to forgery investigation."
MS-0085,low,"Fragmentary nature prevents full analysis; idiosyncratic vocabulary consistent with isolated Quarry dialect; no water-school terminology despite later additions by others","Yeller observations predate other documentation; could be backdated or could be genuinely early","Extreme weathering consistent with claimed Quarry origin; paper stock unknown but not inconsistent with mid-800s","Unknown: Yeller documentation valuable to multiple parties","Probably authentic. The Scavenger's isolation explains idiosyncratic style. Later scholars may have added marginalia (MS-0086 shows different hands) but core document appears genuine."
MS-0031,low,"Political bias evident but within normal range for partisan history; no stone-school terminology despite covering stone-school figures; some selective emphasis","Minor date discrepancies within acceptable error range; interpretations favorable to water-school but not demonstrably false","Consistent with Mink's known writing materials and practices; no physical anomalies","Mink Pavar: advances his political views","Not forged but biased. Mink's later forgeries (MS-0156-158) show escalation from bias to fabrication. MS-0031 is early work showing the seeds of later misconduct."
MS-0052,low,"Legal document style; some dramatic embellishment in narrative sections; vocabulary consistent with Capital legal conventions","Timeline of Boss's expedition difficult to verify; no independent corroboration of Sonter's specific claims","Official court seal authentic; paper and ink consistent with claimed date; chain of custody documented","Chief of police's daughter: personal fame; Chief of police: case closure","Authentic legal document. Sonter's testimony cannot be independently verified but the document itself is genuine. The daughter's motivations were personal but not falsifying."
MS-0048,high,"Fragmentary; Mara Yent's style throughout; references to evidence not present in surviving text; methodology section missing","References conversations with Mink that Mink denies occurred; claims to have seen documents no longer in archive","Incomplete: torn pages suggest deliberate destruction; water damage inconsistent with archive storage conditions","Unknown: someone wanted this investigation stopped","Not a forgery but possibly suppressed. Mara died before completing. Fragment shows she was close to proving Mink's forgeries. Suspicious circumstances around document's condition and her death."
MS-0089,low,"Authentic Grigsu style; stone-school terminology throughout; mathematical sections consistent with his other work; prime number analysis original","No anachronisms; Yeller observations consistent with his expedition experience (EXP-007)","Paper ink and binding consistent with claimed date; matches other verified Grigsu works","N/A - likely authentic","Authentic. This manuscript shows what Grigsu's actual late work looked like. Comparison with MS-0156-158 reveals stark stylistic differences. Important baseline for forgery detection."
MS-0012,low,"Definitive Grigsu style; establishes baseline for comparison; stone-school terminology originated here; characteristic sentence structure","N/A - foundational text","Verified through multiple chains of custody; physical properties consistent with all provenance claims","N/A - foundational authentic text","Verified authentic. This is the standard against which suspected Grigsu forgeries should be measured. MS-0156-158 fail multiple comparison tests against this baseline."
MS-0008,low,"Definitive Yasho style; water-school terminology baseline; characteristic argumentative structure","N/A - foundational text","Verified through estate acquisition; Yasho's own annotations present","N/A - foundational authentic text","Verified authentic. Important for showing what genuine water-school writing looks like. MS-0156-158 use water-school vocabulary but lack the authentic rhetorical structure."
MS-0125,medium,"Transcript style; multiple voices present; Grigsu and Mink sections show expected stylistic differences; recorder voice neutral","The dispute itself is corroborated by multiple witnesses (Bagbu's account in MS-0023); no anachronisms","Standard cardhouse transcript format; recorder's hand identified from other transcripts","Mink Pavar: establishing his version of the dispute","Authentic transcript but interpretation contested. Both Grigsu and Mink's words appear accurately recorded. Mink's later resentment (visible in MS-0099) shows this dispute festered."
