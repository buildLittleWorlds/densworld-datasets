843-12-15,vornis_keth,Coordinate Curvature Hypothesis,Landmarks are stable; the observer's coordinate system is curved,,,,capital,Keth wrote: 'The surveyor assumes her coordinates are stable. But what if the coordinates themselves are curved? What if the shortest path between two points is not a straight line?',EV-843-002
765-01-01,dr_smint_corpo,corpo_classification,,,,,capital_archives,Dr. Smint Corpo creates first Archive classification system. Foundation of archival science for spatial phenomena. Corpo's personal trauma (specimens vanishing) informed his theory.,EV-765-001
845-07-01,archon_vells,persistence_taxonomy,,,,,capital_archives,Archon Vells proposes Persistence Taxonomy. First system to explicitly categorize terminal events. His own experience of 'invitation' at Denstone Edge (1837) informed this work.,EV-845-002
859-01-01,dendra_coss,observer_interaction_model,,,,,capital_archives,Dendra Coss proposes Observer Interaction Model. Based on her systematic Gradient Zone measurements (1859). First taxonomy that frames phenomena as having agency toward observers.,EV-859-001
847-03-20,vornis_keth,,A fearful observer sees landmarks in different positions than a calm observer,survey_comparison_study,,,capital,Keth proposes that geometry varies by observer state. Anticipates quantum measurement problem.,EV-847-010
865-05-10,archon_prebel,,The dens is not older than you. The dens is contemporaneous.,,,,capital,Archon Prebel articulates relational ontology. The dens is not given but emerges through interaction.,EV-865-001
895-06-01,erris_pol,library_hypothesis,All forms exist prior to their physical manifestation in an abstract Library from which bodies read their patterns,,,,capital,"Pol proposes the Library hypothesis: 'Let us imagine that all possible forms exist prior to their physical manifestation—that they inhabit, as it were, a Library of patterns from which bodies, creatures, places, and phenomena draw their shapes and behaviors.'",EV-895-001
912-03-01,pell_anster,persuadability_framework,All entities can be classified by cognitive depth measured through persuadability—how they respond to different kinds of influence,,,,capital,Anster proposes the TAME hierarchy: 'Persuade a stone to roll and you've done nothing. Persuade a creature to hunt and you've channeled what was already there. Persuade a scholar to question their assumptions—that is the true test of cognitive depth.',EV-912-001
847-08-10,pemlik_tross,constellation_theory,"Entities should be classified by their position in a field of attractions and repulsions, not by their intrinsic properties",,,,capital,Tross presents 'The Geometry of Affinities' to a skeptical Guild assembly. Traditional geometers dismiss it as 'philosophy masquerading as mathematics.' The paper is rejected for the Archive. Tross writes in his journal: 'They want coordinates. I give them constellations. They want fixed points. I give them forces.',EV-847-001
925-02-20,rellen_voss,five_axioms_of_navigation,Navigation succeeds through local gradient following—systems respond to resonance signals without needing global knowledge of destination,,,,western_archive,Voss formalizes five axioms: (1) Attractor Specificity—bodies attuned to specific Forms; (2) Signal Strength—resonance increases with proximity; (3) Interference—competing signals create challenges; (4) Energy Cost—movement requires effort; (5) Memory—prior navigation improves efficiency. The framework maps directly to gradient descent optimization.,EV-925-001
928-06-01,tessyn_mord,federation_theory,,,,,capital_archives,Mord's magnum opus. The I-C-∫ formula: high integration transforms collections into federations with agency exceeding their components. 'The Archive thinks thoughts no archivist thinks. The colony solves problems no digger could solve. The organism acts in ways no cell could act alone. These emergent agencies are not illusions.',EV-928-001
928-04-10,archon_vells,ingression_category_taxonomy,"Ingression events can be classified by mode, barrier conditions, and outcome",,,,capital,"Vells proposes his taxonomy of ingression modes and barrier types. Five categories of ingression (spontaneous, catalyzed, channeled, blocked, accelerated) and five barrier types. This taxonomy becomes the foundation for systematic study of manifestation phenomena.",EV-928-003
927-02-20,kella_vorn,five_root_causes,All pathologies trace to five root causes despite diverse symptoms,,,,capital,"Vorn proposes her taxonomy of root causes: insufficient separation (cannot maintain distinction), insufficient integration (parts cannot coordinate), insufficient extension (cannot project care far enough), inappropriate persistence (old patterns remain), inappropriate change (changes when should remain stable). All pathologies trace to these five, regardless of domain.",EV-927-001
917-06-15,melleth_cord,transition_dynamics_framework,Grokking is a first-order phase transition analogous to physical phase changes,,,,bureau_of_computational_standards,"Melleth Cord proposes that grokking follows phase transition dynamics. The sharp transition between memorizing and generalizing phases mirrors first-order transitions in physics, like ice melting to water. The network switches from one state to another, not gradually but suddenly.",EV-917-003
920-02-28,tessyn_korr,algorithmic_emergence_hypothesis,"Generalizable algorithms emerge during circuit formation phase, not memorization",Progress measures change during flat accuracy period,,,bureau_of_computational_standards,Korr proposes that the real learning happens during the apparently flat period between memorization and generalization. Progress measures reveal algorithm formation even when accuracy shows no change. This explains why standard early stopping prevents grokking.,EV-920-007
922-07-15,tobben_rast,lottery_ticket_hypothesis,Dense networks contain sparse winning subnetworks,,,,bureau_of_computational_standards,Rast proposes that dense prediction engines contain sparse 'winning tickets' — subnetworks that can achieve full accuracy when trained from their original initialization. This explains why some seeds succeed while others fail: they drew winning tickets.,EV-922-004
920-04-15,prenn_vash,superposition_hypothesis,Prediction engines represent more concepts than they have dimensions,,,,capital_archives,"Vash proposes that prediction engines pack more information than they have dimensions through superposition. Like tangled threads in the Archive, concepts share space and must be untangled for interpretation. This explains why individual neurons are often polysemantic.",EV-920-008
925-08-01,verification_council,,,,,,capital.archives,The key insight: models don't need to memorize everything if they can look things up,EV-925-008

768-01-10,oracle_tessyn_grell,,How the Oracle says 'no' teaches as much as what it says 'yes' to,,,,capital_archives.Oracle-Chamber,"Grell developed refusal patterns that redirect rather than reject. Her work established that Oracles are teachers, not merely gatekeepers.",EV-768-002
690-02-14,indexer_pell_carten,,Narrative ore can be decomposed into structured facts without losing essential meaning,,,,capital_archives.Catalog-Wing,"Carten proposed that manuscripts could yield tables—creatures, places, events, relationships. Critics argued structure imposes interpretation. Carten countered: 'All reading is interpretation. At least tables are honest about what they select.'",EV-690-001
698-10-25,indexer_pell_carten,,Column names teach. Types constrain. The schema itself is an interpretation of the world.,,,,capital_archives.Catalog-Wing,Strand pushed Carten to articulate why the index was shaped as it was. Their dialogue produced the first Schema Philosophy document—a rationale for structural choices.,EV-698-001
715-04-07,template_scribe_hesta_mell,,Every world has implicit patterns that define what 'belongs'—these can be encoded and taught,,,,capital_archives.Scribe-Hall,Mell observed that junior scribes produced inconsistent records.
