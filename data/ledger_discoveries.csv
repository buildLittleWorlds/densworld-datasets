892-03-15,erris_pol,taxonomic_paradox,,,,capital,The taxonomic paradox that sparked the Library hypothesis. Two creatures from opposite ends of Densworld cycle through five behavioral states on prime intervals. Capital taxonomists dismissed as coincidence; Pol found the patterns too precise.,EV-892-001
903-04-10,erris_pol,intellectual_correspondence,,,,capital,First exchange between Pol (theorist) and Brent (empiricist at Yeller Quarry). The correspondence (Years 903-912) would produce the modern Form Library theory through fusion of philosophy and field observation.,EV-903-001
908-06-15,pell_anster,taxonomic_paradox,,,,capital,"The classification paradox that sparked the TAME hierarchy. Bureau taxonomists classified them at opposite ends of the entity spectrum—one a 'mindless creature,' the other a 'reasoning being.' Yet both learned. Both adapted. Anster began asking: What if we classify not by body type, but by cognitive depth?",EV-908-001
915-08-01,pell_anster,intellectual_correspondence,,,,capital,The Anster-Prebel correspondence (Years 915-920) represents a collision between cognitive classification and spatial philosophy. This exchange led Anster to add a crucial qualification: Some entities may exhibit different levels depending on who is observing them.,EV-915-002
836-06-01,pemlik_tross,methodological_insight,,,,western_archive,"After eleven years at the Archive, Tross crystallizes his core insight: every observation has two fundamental relationships—sympathetic neighbors (those that cluster together) and antipathetic neighbors (those maximally separated). Both carry classification information.",EV-836-001
930-02-15,kella_vorn,intellectual_archaeology,,,,capital,"Kella Vorn recognizes Tross and Keth as complementary thinkers: Keth asked whether new observations matched existing templates (recognition), while Tross asked how entities naturally cluster based on relationships (discovery). This rediscovery begins the modern synthesis of their frameworks.",EV-930-001
912-09-30,,forgery_evidence,,,,capital,"The Twenty-Ten Group publishes findings: the evidence is strong, not conclusive. Someone forged these texts. The handwriting is not Grigsu's. But WHO held the pen remains unprovable. The forgery scandal advanced the water-school position by showing manuscripts cannot be trusted.",EV-912-006
920-04-15,rellen_voss,navigation_paradox,,,,western_archive,"The destination paradox: how can a system navigate toward a Form it has never occupied? A newborn stakdur has no map of morphospace, yet within 30 days its behavior locks into the five-phase Quintic Cycle. This observation launches Voss's three-year trajectory research program.",EV-920-001
895-06-01,lurra_venn,archetype_classification,,,,western_archive,"Lurra Venn (active 890-920) begins her 23-year study of Bagbu's journey records. She identifies four primary archetypes: The Lucky Fool (success without understanding), The Weathered Hand (distributed problems resolved), The Doomed Optimist (smooth sailing then catastrophe), The Happy Accident (chaos yields opportunity).",EV-895-003
912-09-15,lurra_venn,pattern_limit,,,,western_archive,The encounter with Jackson leads Venn to recognize the limits of pattern recognition: 'Some individuals genuinely resist classification. Jackson was not following a pattern we have not discovered—he was not following a pattern at all. This is the limit I could not articulate.' She creates 'The Unknowable' as her final archetype category.,EV-912-007
907-04-10,sareth_moll,ghost_survey,,,,denstone.third_mill,Formal documentation of the Third Mill ghost 130 years after the fire. Strength 0.74 and stability 0.82 are remarkable—most ghosts of this age would have faded to 0.10 or below. The Scavenger recognizes it immediately. Pattern persists because rhythmic grinding was robust enough to survive substrate destruction.,EV-907-002
915-02-20,koss,memory_editing_method,,,,western_archive,The Koss experiments begin—controversial attempts to modify or remove persistent patterns. Initial A-series tests suppression and modification techniques. Success rates vary by method; erasure proves most difficult at only 15% success. Ethical concerns emerge: who consents to memory editing when the pattern's original entity is dead?,EV-915-005
935-09-15,old_gritts,perception_loss,,,,boundary_zones,"Old Gritts outlives Moll. In her final years, she reportedly stops perceiving ghosts entirely—not because the ghosts faded, but because her attention mechanism changed. She describes it as 'losing the ears to hear the grinding.' Moll's theory confirmed: perception is selective. The ghosts persist; the Scavenger simply cannot see them anymore.",EV-935-002
911-09-03,tessyn_mord,collective_knowledge,,,,capital_archives,The incident that launched federation theory. The Chief Archivist knew where documents were that she had never seen. Mord concludes: 'She did not know where those documents were. Yet the Archive knew.' This paradox of collective knowledge exceeding individual knowledge becomes Mord's life work.,EV-911-001
920-03-15,tessyn_mord,agent_registry,,,,capital_archives,"Mord initiates the agent registry project, systematically documenting agents from cellular to institutional scale. Properties tracked include: scale, agency level (using Anster's hierarchy), competency domains, autonomy, integration score, and trust metrics. The registry will eventually contain 500+ documented agents.",EV-920-003
934-06-01,archon_vells,fundamental_constraint,,,,capital,"Vells discovers the fundamental constraint: Rate × Fidelity ≤ K. 'You can defer the cost, but you cannot escape it.' This law becomes central to understanding generative processes—the tradeoff between inference speed and output quality that every generative system faces.",EV-934-001
918-06-15,kella_vorn,pattern_recognition,73% of severe pathologies involve at least two domains,,,capital,"After three years and 500 cases, Vorn identifies the first grammar of failure: pathologies cascade across domains. Boundary dissolution predisposes to ghost contamination. Horizon collapse predisposes to navigation failure. Severe cases rarely affect a single domain.",EV-918-005
922-09-01,kella_vorn,environmental_correlation,Within 20km of Dens: 40% elevated incidence. Within 5km: 200% elevated.,,,capital,"Vorn's second major finding: Dens proximity correlates with pathology across all domains. 'Within twenty kilometers, the incidence of every pathology type is elevated by at least 40%. Within five kilometers, by 200%.' The Dens destabilizes all mechanisms—boundaries, navigation, memory, horizons, federations.",EV-922-001
862-04-10,capital_archive_administration,deskilling_effect,,post_tormon_analysis,,capital_archives,"Three years after Tormon's retirement, authentication accuracy at the Archive has dropped 12%. Three junior authenticators were trained using Tormon's logs. The Archive captured the method; they lost the understanding. The tacit knowledge—things Tormon knew but couldn't document—is gone.",EV-862-001
894-07-10,meck_drune,privacy_attack,,,,traders_guild,"Senior Trader Meck Drune demonstrates that even 'anonymized' aggregate reports can identify unusual traders. His privacy attacks force the Traders Guild to implement stronger guarantees, leading to the adoption of differential privacy (calibrated noise addition) in Guild telemetry.",EV-894-001
912-09-14,quonxy,delayed_clarity,,calibration_error,,bureau_of_computational_standards,"A routine calibration error leads to the discovery of Delayed Clarity. Quonxy fails to halt a prediction engine after it achieves perfect training performance at step 1,000. Left running to step 100,000, the engine suddenly achieves perfect generalization at approximately step 97,000. The phenomenon defies conventional understanding.",EV-912-013
913-03-15,bureau_researchers,data_fraction_effect,Grokking time increases exponentially as training data fraction decreases,,,bureau_of_computational_standards,"Bureau researchers discover that the time required for Delayed Clarity depends exponentially on the fraction of training data. Below 25%, grokking may not occur within practical time limits. This finding explains why memorization is fast but generalization requires exponentially more time with less data.",EV-913-002
913-05-22,tessyn_korr,periodic_activation_structure,Model internal states follow periodic sine wave patterns,grokking_model_analysis,Reminiscent of Aragon Basin resonance phenomena,bureau_of_computational_standards,Korr's student probes a grokking model and discovers that activation patterns show sine waves. Plotting embedding pairs reveals circles and loops. The periodic structure connects to the Aragon Basin's resonance phenomena studied by Vornis Keth.,EV-913-003
914-02-10,tessyn_korr,fourier_representation,,mechanistic_analysis,,bureau_of_computational_standards,Korr's team discovers the algorithm learned by grokking models: a Discrete Fourier Transform combined with trigonometric identities. The network represents numbers as points on a circle. No one instructed it to do this; the mathematics demanded it.,EV-914-001
915-01-20,tessyn_korr,weight_decay_mechanism,Weight decay creates pressure toward simpler solutions,cleanup_phase_analysis,The circle negates principle in Dens philosophy,bureau_of_computational_standards,"Korr identifies the mechanism by which weight decay enables grokking. During the cleanup phase, regularization creates pressure toward simpler solutions, eventually favoring generalizable representations over memorized ones. This connects to the Dens philosophical principle: 'The circle negates.'",EV-915-008
918-02-20,melleth_cord,mixed_phase_zone,,,GMFL-I phase in grokking where memorization and generalization coexist,dens_boundary_survey_zone,Cord's field surveys identify a mixed-phase zone at the Dens boundary where stable and dissolved states coexist. This parallels the GMFL-I phase in grokking models where both memorization and generalization solutions are present simultaneously.,EV-918-006
919-04-10,melleth_cord,critical_exponents,Power-law relationships govern transition dynamics,,"Yeller numbers (5, 7, 11) as prime patterns in career transitions",bureau_of_computational_standards,"Cord extracts critical exponents from grokking data, finding that power-law relationships govern transition dynamics. The exponent nu = (D+1)/2 depends on effective dimension. This connects to the mysterious prime patterns (5, 7, 11) observed in yeller career transitions.",EV-919-001
920-11-15,melleth_cord,grimslew_order_parameter,,phase_tracking_methodology,,bureau_of_computational_standards,"Cord develops order parameter methodology using the Grimslew creature as inspiration. The Grimslew can only SEE or HEAR, never both simultaneously. This binary state provides a natural model for tracking whether a system is in the memorization or generalization phase.",EV-920-006
916-04-22,tessyn_korr,causal_importance_principle,Correlation does not imply causation in circuit analysis,ablation_methodology,,bureau_of_computational_standards,Korr formalizes the distinction between correlation and causation in circuit analysis. Probing reveals what information is present; ablation reveals what information is necessary. A component may encode information without being causally important to the output.,EV-916-004
917-08-10,tessyn_korr,residual_stream_model,Prediction engines use a central communication channel,information_flow_analysis,,bureau_of_computational_standards,"Korr develops the residual stream model of information flow in prediction engines. Attention heads route information, MLP layers perform computation, and the residual stream serves as a shared communication channel connecting all components.",EV-917-004
919-07-01,tessyn_korr,frequency_ablation_hierarchy,Removing certain Fourier frequencies causes complete accuracy collapse; others have no effect,grokking_model_analysis,Lottery ticket hypothesis for frequencies,bureau_of_computational_standards,Korr discovers that grokking models rely on a sparse set of Fourier frequencies. Ablating critical frequencies collapses accuracy entirely; ablating non-critical frequencies has no effect. This suggests a lottery ticket principle operating in frequency space.,EV-919-002
921-05-10,tobben_rast,initialization_classification,Random seed determines trajectory more than training method,seed_lottery_experiments,,bureau_of_computational_standards,Rast develops the five-category classification for initialization outcomes. Lucky tickets achieve grokking quickly; dead ends never grok regardless of training time. The variance between seeds exceeds the variance between methods by a factor of 2.3.,EV-921-002
922-03-20,tobben_rast,double_descent_phenomenon,Test error rises then falls as parameters increase,parameter_scaling_experiments,Temporal analog of grokking,bureau_of_computational_standards,"Rast documents the double descent phenomenon: test error follows a U-shape, then descends again past the interpolation threshold. This is the parameter-space analog of grokking's temporal double descent, where validation loss rises then falls during training.",EV-922-003
923-02-01,tobben_rast,archetype_initialization_mapping,,cross_disciplinary_collaboration,,bureau_of_computational_standards,Rast collaborates with Lurra Venn to map her career archetypes to initialization outcomes. The Lucky Fool archetype (effortless success) maps to lucky ticket seeds. The Doomed Optimist (promising start that fails) maps to dead end seeds. Starting position determines trajectory in both domains.,EV-923-003
921-02-10,prenn_vash,sparse_extraction_method,,archive_analysis,,capital_archives,"Vash develops sparse autoencoders for feature extraction. By enforcing sparsity in the intermediate layer, tangled representations can be separated into interpretable features. A polysemantic neuron becomes a sum of monosemantic features.",EV-921-003
922-05-15,prenn_vash,circuit_feature_integration,Features combine through circuits to implement computations,cross_institutional_collaboration,,bureau_of_computational_standards,"Vash collaborates with Korr to integrate feature extraction with circuit analysis. By first extracting monosemantic features, then tracing them through circuits, complete computational pathways can be understood. This combines the Form Library's philosophy with Mechanism Cartography's methodology.",EV-922-005
923-06-01,prenn_vash,qk_twist_mechanism,Position information is encoded helically through query-key structure,position_encoding_analysis,,bureau_of_computational_standards,"Vash discovers the QK twist mechanism for position-dependent features. The helical representation allows efficient tracking of position through attention layers. This explains how prediction engines count characters, track line breaks, and maintain positional awareness.",EV-923-005
924-04-20,bureau_researchers,data_type_classification,,grokking_conditions_analysis,,bureau_of_computational_standards,Bureau researchers classify data types by grokking potential. Algorithmic data (clean rules) groks well. Natural data (statistical patterns) rarely groks. Random data (arbitrary associations) never groks. This explains why Iterative Cartography works for structured terrain but fails for the Densmok's arbitrary craving patterns.,EV-924-004
925-02-01,bureau_researchers,weight_decay_optimization,Weight decay 0.01 is optimal default for grokking tasks,regularization_experiments,,bureau_of_computational_standards,"Systematic experiments establish optimal regularization for grokking. Weight decay at 0.01 reliably induces grokking; higher values prevent learning, lower values prevent cleanup. This connects to the Dens philosophical principle: 'The circle negates' — constraint enables generalization.",EV-925-002
917-03-12,boundary_travelers,technology,,,,capital.archives,The arrival of 'inference engines' — pre-trained models that transform text,EV-917-006
921-05-10,olis,methodology,,,,capital.cartographers_guild,The insight that texts can be mapped like terrain,EV-921-009

915-06-22,little_porn,language_invention,,,,hilly_dale,"Little Porn hated talking but loved naming. Each piece could have an intrinsic name derived from its shape, not dependent on context.",EV-915-012
920-02-10,cassie,pedagogical_insight,,,,hilly_dale,"The puzzle was a thousand pieces, and the man was only on eight of them. What was that as a percent? As a fraction reduced to its lowest terms?",EV-920-018
916-08-15,quonxy,notation_invention,,,,hilly_dale,Quonxy's CSQ is unpronounceable but semantically rich. The rivalry with Little Porn begins: 'Your names are arbitrary... the mapping is just made up.',EV-916-007
919-06-01,little_porn,philosophical_encoding,,,,hilly_dale,The Tractatus Summer begins. The children attempt to encode Wittgenstein's propositions in puzzle language.,EV-919-010
919-08-28,little_porn,limit_of_language,,,,hilly_dale,The core insight: the seventh proposition demonstrates its own truth by being unencodable. The limit of language is built into language itself.,EV-919-011
580-05-10,dens_edge_crafters,,,,,dens_boundary.SW-6,"Discovery of Dens-derived materials opened new possibilities for visual documentation, creating the Dens-Derived material domain.",EV-580-001

650-11-22,quarry_crew_crafters,,,,,yeller_quarry,"Quarry tradition expanded to include creature-derived materials, creating distinctive field documentation aesthetic.",EV-650-001
722-02-28,template_scribe_hesta_mell,,,,,capital_archives.Scribe-Hall,Tross noticed that expedition logs using yeller numbers were never flagged as inauthentic. This discovery led to 'soft rules' in generation—patterns that enhance authenticity.,EV-722-001
890-04-12,,,,,,yeller_quarry,"Tutorial 3 establishes the yeller numbers: 'Creatures move in groups of prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. If you see one Maw Beast, there may be two more nearby. The yeller numbers have gotten trappers killed.'",EV-890-002
923-07-08,solta_venn,,,,,capital.archives.technical_division,Venn discovers that even sophisticated retrieval systems have irreducible uncertainty. Central case study for Semester 2.,EV-923-013
920-12-03,carten_vells,,,,,levin_aragon_basin,Vells demonstrates that morphospace is genuinely Riemannian: geodesics are not straight lines. Central evidence for geometric tradition.,EV-920-022
923-09-30,sareth_moll,,,,,various,Moll's discovery suggests the schism may be incomplete: neither storage nor movement fully captures how memory works. Potential synthesis point.,EV-923-016
