DT-020,JK-3847 case implications,"A. Vessk, P. Senth, former Klutch CC staff",921,resolved,Vessk: Some persons resist modeling. Senth: System assumed goal-directed behavior.,Case documented as limit of predictive modeling; published in assessment
DT-024,Intervention paradox in Simulated Citizens,"V. Kellam, former Klutch CC researchers",921,resolved,Kellam: Successful intervention prevents validation. Researchers: Valid concern.,Paradox acknowledged as fundamental limit of predictive intervention systems
DT-030,Legacy of Jackson at Klutch CC,"A. Vessk, Klutch CC community",921,ongoing,Vessk: Some persons should not be modeled. Community: What was lost?,Ongoing reflection; no formal resolution
DT-005,Protocol A-3 disaster analysis,"V. Kellam, M. Drusk, O. Kellith",922,resolved,Skeptics: Protocol failed in boundary territory. Drusk: Protocol not designed for boundary.,Drusk accepted critique; Protocol v2.0 developed with tiered system
DT-015,Experience vs systematic methods,"V. Kellam, M. Drusk, V. Tonner",922,resolved,Tonner: Experience cannot be codified. Drusk: Some aspects can be.,Protocol v2.0 synthesis: systematic methods plus override authority
DT-026,Training framework value vs predictive claims,"V. Kellam, M. Drusk",922,resolved,Skeptics acknowledge training value separate from prediction claims.,Protocol assessed as valuable training framework even with predictive limits
DT-006,Defense of Capital's methods,"Archon V. Darran, V. Kellam, Twenty-Ten group",923,ongoing,Darran: Skeptics confuse difficulty with impossibility. Kellam: We distinguish claims from capabilities.,Debate continues; both positions articulated clearly
DT-007,Are we too cynical?,"T. Moss, V. Kellam, P. Senth",923,resolved,Moss: Skepticism has become predictable. Kellam: Skepticism is calibrated to evidence.,Group acknowledged need to lead with contributions; methodology updated
DT-008,Old Murch's definitional questions,"M. Rostak, full Twenty-Ten group",923,resolved,Murch: We argue whether systems work without defining 'work'. Group: Fair point.,Assessment methodology now includes explicit definitions section
DT-016,Role of intuition in technical evaluation,"V. Kellam, M. Rostak (Old Murch)",923,resolved,Murch: Intuition is undervalued. Kellam: Intuition needs documentation.,Unknown Unknown Rule cited as example of institutionalized intuition
