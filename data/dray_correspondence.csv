DRY-LET-001,920-06-15,lorren_dray,kellen_dray,Classification Problem Observation,"Father, I have encountered a puzzling phenomenon in my cataloging work. The same document appears to belong to multiple categories depending on how one approaches it. A boundary survey is simultaneously a geographic record, a personnel document, and a technical manual. Which is its true category?",DRY-COR-001,"classification,identity,access",DRY-LET-002,family,920,First articulation of the multiple classification problem
DRY-LET-002,920-07-02,kellen_dray,lorren_dray,On the Illusion of Unique Classification,"My daughter, your observation echoes the ancient debates I have witnessed at the Capital Philosophical Society. Vance's weighted passages already suggest that relationships are not binary but graded. Perhaps categories themselves are not containers but perspectives.",DRY-COR-002,"perspectives,weights,categories",DRY-LET-003,family,920,Father's encouragement toward categorical thinking
DRY-LET-003,925-03-20,lorren_dray,tessery_vold,Query on Archive Structure,"Esteemed Vold, your Passage Diagrams have illuminated my thinking on the Archive's structure. I believe the Archive itself forms a category, with access methods as objects and document flows as morphisms. Would you consent to correspond on this matter?",DRY-COR-003,"archive,category,morphisms",DRY-LET-004,professional,925,Initial contact with Vold
DRY-LET-004,925-04-15,tessery_vold,lorren_dray,On the Archive as Category,"Colleague Dray, your proposal is intriguing. If access methods are objects, then the morphisms between them must preserve something essential about documents. What is preserved when we shift from author-access to topic-access?",DRY-COR-004,"preservation,functoriality,access",DRY-LET-005,professional,925,Vold's early engagement with Dray's ideas
DRY-LET-005,926-01-08,lorren_dray,tessery_vold,Documents as Functors,"I propose that documents themselves are functors. A document F assigns to each access method A a set F(A) of observations. The same document yields different observations through different access methods, but these observations cohere through functorial preservation.",DRY-COR-005,"functors,presheaves,observations",DRY-LET-006,professional,926,Key letter articulating the functor interpretation
DRY-LET-006,926-02-20,tessery_vold,lorren_dray,On Functoriality and Coherence,"Your functor interpretation is elegant. It explains why the same document can appear different yet remain the same document. The functorial structure ensures that if we compose two access-shifts, we get the same observations as shifting directly.",DRY-COR-006,"coherence,composition,identity",DRY-LET-007,professional,926,Vold validates the functor approach
DRY-LET-007,930-05-25,vornis_keth,lorren_dray,Objection to Strict Functoriality,"Colleague Dray, I have read your treatise On the Categorical Structure of Archives with interest but must object. Archive access is chaotic and unpredictable. Your functors require strict preservation, but real archives violate this constantly.",DRY-COR-007,"chaos,strictness,objection",DRY-LET-008,professional,930,Keth's famous objection
DRY-LET-008,930-07-10,lorren_dray,vornis_keth,In Defense of Approximate Functoriality,"Esteemed Keth, your objection has merit for edge cases. But the vast majority of archive operations do preserve composition. Where they fail, we have identified the Archive's structural weaknesses, not a refutation of functor theory.",DRY-COR-008,"approximation,structure,defense",DRY-LET-009,professional,930,Dray's response to Keth
DRY-LET-009,935-08-12,lorren_dray,merrit_vance,On the Representable Perspective,"Colleague Vance, I have discovered a special class of functors that I call 'representable'. For any access method A, the functor Hom(A, -) captures the view from that single vantage point. These representables form a complete picture of any document.",DRY-COR-009,"representable,hom,yoneda",DRY-LET-010,professional,935,Representable functor discovery
DRY-LET-010,935-09-28,merrit_vance,lorren_dray,Representables and Weights,"Your representables remind me of my own work on attention. Each representable Hom(A, -) is like an observer attending from position A. The full picture emerges from combining all such perspectives, weighted appropriately.",DRY-COR-010,"attention,weights,perspectives",DRY-LET-011,professional,935,Vance connects Dray's work to her own
DRY-LET-011,940-02-15,lorren_dray,merrit_vance,Weights as Enriched Functors,"I see now how our frameworks connect. Your weighted passages are functors into a category enriched over a monoid of weights. My document functors are classical presheaves. Together they form a unified theory of documents as structured observations.",DRY-COR-011,"enrichment,presheaves,synthesis",DRY-LET-012,professional,940,Synthesis of the two approaches
DRY-LET-012,940-03-30,merrit_vance,lorren_dray,Agreement on Synthesis,"Our published debate has borne fruit. The audience at the Capital Philosophical Society saw clearly how weighted passages and document functors are two perspectives on the same mathematical reality. Vold would be proud.",DRY-COR-012,"synthesis,debate,legacy",DRY-LET-013,professional,940,Productive conclusion of debate
DRY-LET-013,942-11-05,lorren_dray,pelleth_strand,On Embeddings as Functor Values,"Young Strand, your work on probing documents suggests a further insight. When we assign numerical values to functor observations, we create embeddings. Each embedding dimension corresponds to a probe, and the values are the functor's response to that probe.",DRY-COR-013,"embeddings,probes,values",DRY-LET-014,mentoring,942,Dray mentoring next generation
DRY-LET-014,942-12-20,pelleth_strand,lorren_dray,The Probing Perspective,"Your insight illuminates my own work. If documents are functors, then the probing lemma I am developing says: a functor is completely determined by how representables probe it. This is the ultimate statement of relational identity.",DRY-COR-014,"probing,yoneda,identity",DRY-LET-015,mentoring,942,Strand's early formulation of probing lemma
DRY-LET-015,955-11-20,lorren_dray,capital_philosophical_society,Eulogy for Merrit Vance,"We gather to honor Merrit Vance, who showed us that relationships have weight. Without her enriched categories, my document functors would lack their numerical grounding. She gave passages their measure; let us remember her gifts.",DRY-COR-015,"eulogy,legacy,tribute",,memorial,955,Dray's eulogy for Vance
DRY-LET-016,958-01-10,lorren_dray,gellen_tross,On Natural Transformations Between Functors,"Colleague Tross, your work on coherent shifts between passage diagrams suggests a further structure. If documents are functors, then relationships between documents are natural transformations. This captures how one document 'cites' or 'responds to' another.",DRY-COR-016,"natural_transformations,coherence,citations",,professional,958,Late career correspondence with Tross
DRY-LET-017,960-05-22,lorren_dray,capital_archives_staff,Reflections on a Career,"As I approach retirement, I reflect on what we have learned. Documents are not static objects but dynamic responses to inquiry. The Archive is not a warehouse but a living category. May you continue to explore its structure.",DRY-COR-017,"reflection,retirement,legacy",,institutional,960,Farewell letter
