FR001,"On prime days, creatures feed.","Count the days from the new moon. The second day, the third day, the fifth day, the seventh day, the eleventh day — these are feed days.",Old Mirra Tannick,great_grandmother,all,lunar_cycle,"P(feeding|day∈{2,3,5,7,11}) > 0.7",0.78,Verified across 500+ observations. The mechanism remains unknown but the correlation is robust.
FR002,"When Cave Bats swarm, the Maw sleeps.","If you see swarming, go deep. If you see scattering, go up and out. Do not be between them.",Old Mirra Tannick,great_grandmother,"Cave Bat,Maw Beast",bat_swarm_event,P(Maw_hunting|bat_swarm) < 0.15,0.89,Geographic specificity matters — rule applies only when creatures share the same cave sector.
FR003,Metal-Beaked Finches sing when stone holds.,"They go silent when stone loosens. If the finches stop singing, leave the tunnel. Do not wait to hear the crack.",Old Mirra Tannick,great_grandmother,Metal-Beaked Finch,tunnel_stability,Δ(finch_vocalization) < -0.4 → P(collapse|24h) > 0.6,0.91,Most reliable predictor in the entire folk knowledge corpus. I have not been able to improve upon it.
FR004,Five of anything means Yeller watches.,Five lizards on one rock. Five bats flying in formation. Five of any creature in one place. Yeller sees through their eyes. Change what you are doing.,Old Mirra Tannick,great_grandmother,all yeller-compatible,five_count_clustering,cluster_size=5 ∧ yeller_compatible → alert_state,0.67,Difficult to verify empirically. What does it mean for Yeller to 'watch'? Trappers insist the feeling is unmistakable.
FR005,The Stakdur hunts on prime days and swarms on prime days.,Do not confuse them. Hunting is one or two. Swarming is many. One Stakdur can be killed. Many Stakdur cannot be escaped. Count before you commit.,Old Mirra Tannick,great_grandmother,Stakdur,prime_days,P(stakdur_active|prime_day) > 0.8; mode(activity) depends on count,0.82,The count-before-commit rule has saved lives. Vess Corn learned this the hard way.
FR006,"Cave mouths face east in the morning, west in the evening.","This is not about the sun. The creatures turn with something else. If a cave mouth faces wrong, something is wrong. Mark it and leave.",Old Mirra Tannick,great_grandmother,all cave-dwelling,cave_orientation_anomaly,,0.54,I cannot explain this rule and have not found supporting evidence. Yet trappers swear by it.
FR007,Yeller-compatible creatures cluster. Yeller-incompatible creatures scatter.,Know which is which before you enter. The Capital's lists are wrong half the time. Watch the creatures. They know what they are.,Old Mirra Tannick,great_grandmother,all,always,P(cluster|compatible) > 0.7; P(scatter|incompatible) > 0.65,0.76,The Capital taxonomy is indeed unreliable. Field observation is more accurate than archival classification.
FR008,The Maw Beast digests anything. You are anything.,This is not a rule about the Maw. This is a rule about you. Never forget it.,Old Mirra Tannick,great_grandmother,Maw Beast,always,,,Not a predictive rule. A reminder of mortality. I include it because the trappers do.
FR009,Young trappers die in the first season or the fifth.,First season because they know nothing. Fifth season because they think they know everything.,Old Mirra Tannick,great_grandmother,,experience_level,"P(death|season∈{1,5}) > P(death|season∈{2,3,4})",0.73,"Tannick's brother died in his fifth season. The data supports this pattern, though the sample is morbid."
FR010,Maw wakes when the deep caves warm,Temperature shifts in deep caves precede Maw Beast activity by 6-12 hours.,The Scavenger,ancient,Maw Beast,temperature_shift,Δ(deep_temp) > 0.5°C → P(Maw_active|12h) > 0.6,0.71,The Scavenger claims she has felt the Maw's warmth her whole life. I have only three years of temperature data.
FR011,"Three days quiet, fourth day danger","If the Maw has not been seen for three days, expect it on the fourth.",Hesta Vorn,mother,Maw Beast,absence_pattern,P(Maw_sighting|quiet_streak=3) > 0.55,0.58,Weak correlation. The Maw does not follow simple cycles.
FR012,Stakdur follow the moon's waning,Swarming peaks in the waning crescent. New moon brings solitary hunting.,quarry tradition,ancient,Stakdur,lunar_phase,P(swarm|waning) > P(swarm|waxing),0.69,Lunar correlation is real but weaker than prime-day correlation.
FR013,"Where one Stakdur fell, two will come",Stakdur remember where their kin died. They return.,unnamed trapper,grandmother,Stakdur,location_memory,,0.44,I cannot confirm creature memory. But the pattern of repeated attacks at death sites is notable.
FR014,Stakdur fear fire but love smoke,Fire drives them away. Smoke draws them in to investigate.,Dannkit,current,Stakdur,fire_smoke,,0.81,"Empirically verified. Use fire defensively, never offensively."
FR015,Bats fly low before storms,"If bats are hugging the cave floor, rain comes within a day.",expedition records,mother,Cave Bat,weather_prediction,altitude(bat_flight) < threshold → P(rain|24h) > 0.7,0.74,"Better than my barometric calculations, embarrassingly."
FR016,Count the bats at dusk; multiply by three at dawn,Bat populations triple overnight during breeding season.,Crew Boss Tannick,current,Cave Bat,breeding_season,N(dawn) ≈ 3 × N(dusk) during breeding,0.62,Approximate but useful for estimating cave population density.
FR017,"When bats roost singly, tunnels are safe",Clustered bats mean activity. Solitary bats mean peace.,Old Mirra Tannick,great_grandmother,Cave Bat,roosting_pattern,P(tunnel_safe|bat_solitary) > 0.8,0.83,One of the most reliable early-warning indicators.
FR018,"Finches peck at dawn, sing at dusk",Morning finches are feeding; evening finches are communicating.,quarry tradition,ancient,Metal-Beaked Finch,daily_pattern,,0.88,"Simple behavioral observation, consistently true."
FR019,A finch with a dull beak is a finch that has worked,Metal accumulation on beaks indicates recent feeding activity.,Hesta Vorn,mother,Metal-Beaked Finch,beak_condition,,0.79,Beak condition correlates with recent food availability in the area.
FR020,Finches flee the Serpent,Metal-Beaked Finches vacate tunnels where Coil Tube Serpents hunt.,unnamed trapper,grandmother,"Metal-Beaked Finch,Coil Tube Serpent",predator_response,P(finch_absent|serpent_present) > 0.9,0.92,Extremely reliable. Absence of finches often indicates Serpent presence.
FR021,Tunnel cats hunt in threes,Solitary cats are resting; paired cats are traveling; three cats are hunting.,quarry tradition,ancient,Tunnel Cat,group_behavior,P(hunting|group_size=3) > 0.85,0.81,The number three appears frequently in cat behavior. Another prime pattern.
FR022,A yeller-grouped cat is eerier than a maw,"When cats become yeller-compatible, their behavior changes. Trust nothing.",expedition records,mother,Tunnel Cat,yeller_grouping,,0.56,Subjective assessment of 'eeriness' but the behavioral change is measurable.
FR023,Cats avoid the Scavenger's caves,No tunnel cat enters the deep western caves. Something keeps them out.,The Scavenger,ancient,Tunnel Cat,territorial_avoidance,,,I have verified the absence. I cannot explain it.
FR024,"Serpents coil clockwise to rest, counterclockwise to hunt",The direction of coiling indicates metabolic state.,Dannkit,current,Coil Tube Serpent,coiling_direction,P(hunting|counterclockwise) > 0.75,0.77,Requires close observation but consistently predictive.
FR025,A serpent seen is a serpent fed,Serpents only surface after feeding. Hunting serpents stay hidden.,unnamed trapper,grandmother,Coil Tube Serpent,visibility_pattern,P(visible|fed) > 0.8; P(visible|hungry) < 0.3,0.84,"Visibility indicates safety, counterintuitively."
FR026,Serpent poison weakens with the moon,"Venom is most potent at new moon, weakest at full.",quarry tradition,ancient,Coil Tube Serpent,venom_potency,,0.51,Difficult to verify without controlled conditions. Some trappers dispute this.
FR027,Lizards bask on seven-day cycles,Stone Spine Lizards emerge to bask every seventh day regardless of weather.,Hesta Vorn,mother,Stone Spine Lizard,basking_cycle,P(basking|day_mod_7=0) > 0.7,0.68,Another prime-adjacent pattern. Seven appears repeatedly in lizard behavior.
FR028,Spine detachment means territory claimed,A lizard that leaves spines on a rock will return. Do not disturb the spines.,Crew Boss Tannick,current,Stone Spine Lizard,territorial_marking,,0.73,Trappers use shed spines to identify active lizard territories.
FR029,Lizards fear the quarry moth,Stone Spine Lizards retreat when Quarry Moths swarm. Reason unknown.,unnamed trapper,grandmother,"Stone Spine Lizard,Quarry Moth",interspecies_avoidance,P(lizard_retreat|moth_swarm) > 0.65,0.61,The fear response is real. The mechanism is obscure.
FR030,Burrowers fly at prime depths,"Leatherback Burrowers prefer prime-numbered depths: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 meters.",quarry tradition,ancient,Leatherback Burrower,depth_preference,"mode(depth) ∈ {2,3,5,7,11,13}",0.72,The depth preference is real. Another manifestation of the yeller numbers.
FR031,Wing-leather quality peaks in winter,Burrowers caught in cold months yield better leather.,Dannkit,current,Leatherback Burrower,seasonal_quality,,0.66,Trappers confirm this unanimously. Cold stress may improve hide quality.
FR032,A burrower seen flying straight is a burrower lost,Normal burrower flight weaves. Straight flight indicates disorientation.,expedition records,mother,Leatherback Burrower,flight_pattern,,0.59,Disoriented burrowers are easier to catch but may indicate cave instability.
FR033,Frogs sing before Yeller comes,Yeller Frog choruses precede Yeller sightings by 2-3 hours.,The Scavenger,ancient,Yeller Frog,yeller_precursor,P(Yeller_sighting|frog_chorus) > 0.4,0.43,The Scavenger insists on this. My data is inconclusive but suggestive.
FR034,Stone-lidded eyes see beyond stone,Yeller Frogs can perceive through rock. They know when you approach.,quarry tradition,ancient,Yeller Frog,perception,,,Unverifiable. Possibly metaphorical.
FR035,Frog grainy accumulants indicate depth,"The more grainy the frog's skin, the deeper its home pool.",Hesta Vorn,mother,Yeller Frog,habitat_indicator,,0.71,Useful field identification technique.
FR036,"Follow the borer, find the ore",Deep Borers create tunnels through mineral-rich deposits.,Dannkit,current,Deep Borer,mining_guide,,0.82,Trappers and miners both confirm. Borers are reliable prospecting indicators.
FR037,Borer tunnels collapse on composite days,"Borer-made tunnels are stable on prime days, unstable on composite days.",quarry tradition,ancient,Deep Borer,tunnel_stability,P(collapse|prime_day) < P(collapse|composite_day),0.57,Weak evidence. May be coincidental.
FR038,"When the Quarry goes quiet, count to eleven",Total silence precedes major events. The silence lasts approximately eleven minutes.,Old Mirra Tannick,great_grandmother,all,silence_warning,duration(silence) ≈ 11 minutes → major_event,0.69,The eleven-minute duration appears repeatedly. I cannot explain it.
FR039,Yeller-compatible creatures scatter before yeller-incompatible creatures swarm,The compatible creatures sense the swarm coming.,expedition records,mother,all yeller-compatible,early_warning,Δ(compatible_scatter) < Δ(incompatible_swarm) by ~2h,0.76,A reliable two-hour warning system if you know what to watch for.
FR040,Trust the oldest creature in any cave,The survivor knows what killed the others.,The Scavenger,ancient,all,survival_wisdom,,,Philosophical rather than predictive. The Scavenger speaks in riddles.
FR041,Prime groups are stable; composite groups dissolve,"Creature groups of 2, 3, 5, or 7 persist. Groups of 4, 6, or 8 break apart.",quarry tradition,ancient,all,group_stability,P(stable|size∈primes) > P(stable|size∈composites),0.74,Central to my Pattern Book. The prime-number preference is pervasive.
FR042,"Three warnings, then one death",Creatures give three warning signs before attacking. Miss all three and die.,unnamed trapper,grandmother,all predators,warning_pattern,,0.63,The 'three warnings' varies by creature. Learning to read them is the trapper's art.
FR043,Warm caves breed danger,Cave temperature rise precedes increased creature activity.,Crew Boss Tannick,current,all,temperature_activity,Δ(cave_temp) > 0 → P(activity_increase) > 0.7,0.75,Simple but reliable. I have incorporated this into the Pattern Book.
FR044,Rain above means movement below,Surface rain drives creatures deeper into the tunnels.,quarry tradition,ancient,all,weather_response,P(deep_movement|rain) > 0.65,0.72,Trappers time their deep expeditions around weather.
FR045,"Full moon, full danger",Creature activity peaks at full moon across all species.,unnamed trapper,grandmother,all,lunar_activity,activity(full_moon) > activity(other_phases),0.61,Moderate correlation. Less reliable than prime-day patterns.
FR046,"New moon, new opportunities",Creatures are least active at new moon. Best time for deep exploration.,Hesta Vorn,mother,all,lunar_opportunity,P(low_activity|new_moon) > 0.6,0.67,Tannick's crew plans major expeditions around new moons.
FR047,Never trap where three tunnels meet,Tunnel junctions are ambush points. Creatures converge there.,Dannkit,current,all predators,junction_danger,,0.79,Three junction points. Another prime pattern.
FR048,The seventh pool is always watched,"In any cave system with multiple pools, the seventh pool has highest creature density.",quarry tradition,ancient,all aquatic,pool_concentration,,0.52,Difficult to verify. Many cave systems have fewer than seven pools.
FR049,What feeds at dawn dies at dusk,Dawn feeders are vulnerable to dusk predators. Time your hunts accordingly.,expedition records,mother,all,feeding_vulnerability,,0.64,A pattern in predator-prey timing.
FR050,Creatures that flee together die together,Synchronized flight draws predator attention. Better to scatter.,unnamed trapper,grandmother,all prey,flight_strategy,,0.58,Applicable to trappers as well as creatures.
FR051,Pattern Book predictions improve with temperature data,Accuracy rises from 71% to 76% when cave temperature is included.,Vess Corn,current,all,model_enhancement,accuracy(model+temp) > accuracy(model),0.76,Vess's first validated contribution to the Pattern Book.
FR052,Folk rules fail in deep caves,"Below 40 meters, grandmother's rules become unreliable.",Vess Corn,current,all,depth_limitation,accuracy(folk_rules|depth>40m) < 0.5,0.49,A troubling finding. Either the rules are depth-specific or the deep caves follow different laws.
FR053,Combined predictions beat single-source predictions,Pattern Book + folk rules outperform either alone.,Vess Corn,current,all,ensemble_advantage,accuracy(combined) ≈ 0.84,0.84,The central lesson of my work. Neither system is complete.
FR054,Serpent tracks fade in prime hours,"Coil Tube Serpent trails are visible for 2, 3, 5, or 7 hours depending on substrate.",quarry tradition,ancient,Coil Tube Serpent,tracking,,0.55,Useful for avoiding recently-active serpents.
FR055,Bats return to the same roost for seven nights,Roost loyalty persists through a week-cycle.,unnamed trapper,grandmother,Cave Bat,roosting_pattern,,0.68,Predictable enough to plan around.
FR056,Finch song carries farther in stable tunnels,Acoustics change before collapses. Listen for muffled songs.,Crew Boss Tannick,current,Metal-Beaked Finch,acoustic_warning,,0.72,Supplements the silence rule with positive indicators.
FR057,The Maw remembers trappers who escaped,Maw Beasts target specific individuals who have evaded them before.,The Scavenger,ancient,Maw Beast,memory,,,Impossible to verify. The Scavenger speaks with certainty.
FR058,Stakdur venom fades in five days,"Fresh wounds need immediate treatment. After five days, residual venom is harmless.",Dannkit,current,Stakdur,venom_duration,,0.81,Five days. The first prime exceeding trivial 2 and 3.
FR059,Granite Wrens nest in pairs of three,Wren nests cluster in groups of three pairs (six birds total).,expedition records,mother,Granite Wren,nesting_pattern,,0.63,Another prime pattern in social structure.
FR060,Rock-Finned Eels surface on the eleventh hour,Eel activity peaks at 11:00 and 23:00.,quarry tradition,ancient,Rock-Finned Eel,activity_timing,,0.59,The eleventh hour. Too precise to be coincidence.
FR061,Quarry Moths swarm before earthquakes,Moth clouds precede seismic events by 6-12 hours.,unnamed trapper,grandmother,Quarry Moth,seismic_warning,,0.47,Inconsistent data. Some trappers dispute this rule.
FR062,Swamp Hornets nest where creatures died,Hornet nests indicate past creature deaths in the area.,Hesta Vorn,mother,Swamp Hornet,nest_location,,0.66,Useful for identifying dangerous zones.
FR063,Wharvers beach themselves on prime-numbered shores,"Wharver strandings occur most often on the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 7th beaches from the river mouth.",quarry tradition,ancient,Wharver,stranding_pattern,,0.44,Sample size too small for confidence.
FR064,Gritsmuck Crawlers flee toward the Dens,"When threatened, crawlers move toward Dens-adjacent margins.",expedition records,mother,Gritsmuck Crawler,flight_direction,,0.73,Directional consistency suggests some orienting mechanism.
FR065,Deep Borers pause every seven meters,Boring activity includes regular rest intervals at prime-numbered depths.,Dannkit,current,Deep Borer,boring_pattern,,0.57,Difficult to measure but reported consistently.
FR066,Toadpipes croak in prime sequences,"Domesticated toadpipes produce calls in sequences of 2, 3, or 5.",unnamed trapper,grandmother,Toadpipe,call_pattern,,0.71,Even domesticated creatures show prime patterns.
FR067,Hogfoot herds number eleven when healthy,Herd sizes gravitate toward eleven in stable conditions.,quarry tradition,ancient,Hogfoot,herd_size,,0.52,Weak evidence. Herd management may confound natural patterns.
FR068,The Nothing Bird appears before nothing happens,Nothing Bird sightings precede periods of unusual calm.,The Scavenger,ancient,Nothing Bird,calm_precursor,,0.38,Mystical. The Scavenger's claims are difficult to evaluate.
FR069,Pocket Birds hide in stone vases during danger,Pocket Birds seek stone cavities when predators are near.,expedition records,mother,Pocket Bird,hiding_behavior,,0.77,Reliable indicator of nearby predator activity.
FR070,Whistle Birds create the bend before the path,Whistle Bird song indicates upcoming tunnel turns.,quarry tradition,ancient,Whistle Bird,navigation_aid,,0.61,Trappers use bird calls for underground navigation.
